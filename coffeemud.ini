######################################################################

# PREJUDICE is used to define both the buying and selling
# adjustments which shopkeepers will give by default, both 
# to everyone or to selected races.  An entry is required for each 
# adjustment by race.  Each entry is separated by a semicolon, and must
# begin with either BUY= or SELL=.  Each entry may end with the name of
# more than one race to apply to other than everyone. The values for BUY=
# and SELL= are Real (decimal) numbers, with 1.0 meaning NO adjustment.
# See the Archon's Guide under GenShopKeeper for more information on this
# field.
# This field may also be defined for individual shopkeepers.
# The value here is only the default when no individual value is given.
# Default value is empty, which uses adjustment 1.0 for everyone.
# An example value would be:
# BUY=5.5 SELL=0.8 Elf Dwarf;BUY=2.0 SELL=0.9 Human;BUY=1.0;SELL=.99
PREJUDICE=

# IGNOREMASK is used to define a default value for the sort of
# people shopkeepers, bankers, and postal clerks will rudely ignore.
# This field may also be defined for individual mobs also.
# The value here is only the default when no individual value is given.
# Default value is empty, which means noone is ignored.  Otherwise,
# see the HELP entry for PROP_HAVEZAPPER for more information
# on how to encode masks in CoffeeMud.
# BUY=-CLASS +Fighter -RACE +Elf
IGNOREMASK=

# BUDGET is used to define the maximum amount of money, per a defined
# time period, which shopkeepers will spend when buying equipment from 
# players.  The format of the field is an amount of gold followed by
# the name of period (HOUR, DAY, WEEK, MONTH, YEAR).  All of these time
# periods are **MUD** time periods, where one hour is about 10 minutes of
# real life time.  
# This field may also be defined for individual shopkeepers.
# The value here is only the default when no individual value is given.
# The default is 20000 MONTH
BUDGET=20000 MONTH

# DEVALUERATE is the percentage drop in price for every additional item
# of a given name that is sold to the shopkeeper.  This rate is always
# taken off of an items base price, so that a devalue rate of 100 (100%)
# will always limit a shopkeeper from buying more than one, 50 limits to
# 2, 25 limits to 4, 12.5 to 8, and so forth.  
# If a single value is given, it will apply to all items.  If two values
# are given, separated by spaces, then the first will apply to all items,
# and the second only to raw resource items (raw wood, raw metals, stone, etc).
# The Default is "20 0.2" (20% 0.2%) which means 0.2% for resources, 20% other Items.
# This field may also be defined for individual shopkeepers.
# The value here is only the default when no individual value is given.
DEVALUERATE=20 0.2

# INVRESETRATE is the frequency, in ticks (4 second intervals), that a
# shopkeeper, by default, will totally reset his inventory.  This means
# that any items purchased from players will be cleared out, and any
# default stock will be replentished.  A value of 0 means that the
# shopkeeper NEVER resets his inventory.  A value above 0 is the 
# amoung of time, in ticks.  The default is 64800 (about 3 real life days).
# This field may also be defined for individual shopkeepers.
# The value here is only the default when no individual value is given.

# Debug/internal flags
######################################################################

# The DISABLE flag is normally used by developers to turn off certain
# mud subsystems for testing purposes.  It can also be used to disable
# all experience gaining and losing as well as level gaining and losing.
# Races and Classes can also be disabled from display, although they still
# impact skill qualifications and other factors behind the scenes.  If races
# are disabled, then all new players be set to "PlayerRace" if it exists, or
# StdRace otherwise.  If classes are disabled, all new players will be set to 
# "PlayerClass" if it exists, or  StdCharClass otherwise.
# The flag values entered are comma delimited, and include the following:
#    SAVETHREAD, UTILITHREAD, CLANTICKS, MUDCHAT, ARREST, CONQUEST
#    SCRIPTABLE, EMOTERS, MOBILITY, QUESTS, RANDOMMONSTERS, STATS,
#    LEVELS, EXPERIENCE, RACES, CLASSES, CONNSPAMBLOCK
DISABLE=

# The DEBUG flag should be used only by developers who want lots of
# extra logging in order to fix bugs.  These values are also comma delimited.
# DEBUG supports the following so far (remember to turn on DBGMSGS ABOVE!):
#    MESSAGES, HTTPREQ, EXPORT, GEAS, IMC2, I3
#    DBROOMS, CMROIT, CMROEX, CMROCH, CMROOM, CMAREA, CMSTAT
#    SMTPCLIENT, AUTOPURGE
DEBUG=

# The SAVE flag changes the normal saving and updating features
# of the mud. Each value is comma delimited.  Values include:
# NOPLAYERS - turns off player auto-saving and shutdown-save. Manual SAVE only!
# NOPROPERTYMOBS - turns off player/clan property mob saving.
# NOPROPERTYITEMSS - turns off player/clan property item saving.
# ROOMMOBS - turns on mob re-saving for ALL rooms at shutdown.
# ROOMSHOPS - turns on mob/shopkeeper saving for ALL rooms at shutdown.
# ROOMITEMS - turns on item saving for ALL rooms (except junk) at shutdown.
