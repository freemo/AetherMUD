# These variables denote the paths to the several different required objects
# which are loaded at boot time.  If you use any special objects not 
# included in the base CoffeeMud distribution, you may add the 
# paths to your classes below. 
# You may want to check out the Programming Guide (Programming.html in your 
# guides/ directory) at some point for more information on developing 
# custom CoffeeMud classes.
# To use this feature, you may include any number of semicolon separated 
# paths.  Use '%DEFAULT%' to include the default class paths for the CoffeeMud 
# distribution.  The default for all of these is %DEFAULT%.  For example:
# ITEMS=%DEFAULT%;C\:\\Projects\\ExtraClasses\\Items\\
# MOBS=%DEFAULT%;C\:\\Projects\\ExtraClasses\\Mobs\\
