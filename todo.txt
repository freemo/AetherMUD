New Ideas are now kept in the WebIQ session. This list will no longer be kept as up to 
date, but only occassionally, to spark the interest and amusement of downloaders.

Misc/Architecture:
==================
add floating num to resources -- whether the item will float
clan boss deletion automatically assigns a new one
Programming.html updates: 	need special section for languages, poisons, diseases, traps
GenRaces
GenCharClasses -- zappercheck on quals
racial abilities (abilities tied to the race)
certain days of the year to be special "holidays", and have my mobs celebrate by dancing in the streets!
property on abilities that describes what to say when already affected by it.
race specific questions to have during the character creation process -- stored where?
Some solution for variable eq on mobs -- use rejuv!
Item Interactivity (Scriptable + socials that require an ITEM target) Tapping your broadsword.  Poking some strange item you found on the critter you just killed.  Licking, sniffing, tasting food.  
Mortgages (bankers lend large amounts of money at interest, start taking away property if you don't pay up)
property to allow ongoing payments to hirelings -- they're permanent, so long as they can suck money from a bank account.
SMTP capability
code something to coffeemudify all the beds
save player affects in the db
Gaian is weak on qualifying chants.  
give rooms maximum weight saveable to db
Allow archons to define channels using the zapper codes 
zapper check on quests and questchats for eligible players
Make size important for weapons.  Characters can hold items of (Char Size/2) in one hand, and (2*Char size) in 2 hands.
apply languages to writing as well. Should be simple, right? ha!
Weather affecting movement, flooding, slipping, vision.  Behaviors for floods and fires.
parse out all the commands into classes, so that access can be class based, and time req can be determined
could you expand the languages to include GOBLIN, GIANT, TERRAN (earth), AQUAN (water), IGNAN(fire), and AURIAL(air), and SYLVAN (woodland)?
BOOKS! paper with multiple pages to post on. Add to the papermaking skill.
msx support
resource override parameter allows for resources to APPEAR as different names. For example ResourceOverride(berries smurfberries)
have a setting for no prompt, which also takes out the blank line after the prompt.
possible to have NE SE SW NW directions?  Yes, but StdMap and MUDGrinder would get hit hard...
LYING DOWN position?
Kneeling position (for prayers/serves and anything else that may need it).
group formations as an alternative way of determining range
if you tell enough 'sentient'(?) muds a rumour it spreads throughout town/area/world?
quest points could be used to raise max stat (but not the actual stat).
a config to allow a linefeed at ticks
quest points can be used to avoid instantdeath rooms, it teleports you back to recall, but without the loss of life, XP, and equipment.
Corpses should note time/manner of death
maybe doors in your house need to be able to stay in the state you last left them (unless they are SMARTdoors of the future....)
ability to deposit in someone elses bank account

	than about 30% of max HP.  Good for limping back to town for a cleric, 
	but doesn't ruin the need for a cleric.  And it's another use for cloth.

	depending on the skill it would actually search the racial database

	MOB or any player in your group.



Songs:
======
Cadence
	All group members get same movement rate regardless of encumbrance, etc.
Mana Pool
	All party members divide the cost of any mana consumption.



Character Classes:
==================
Cavalier 
	Fighter subclass
	The knight---mounted fighter.
Tinkerer
	This will be for when the high tech stuff comes, but essentially the high tech equivalent of arcanist.
Bounty Hunter 
	Thief subclass, combination trapper/ranger I'm thinking.  
	Bring bounties to Judge (Hassan) for reward of xp/gold.
Wild Mage
	50% of the time, a spell cast will end up higher level, different spell.



Diseases:

	Will starve, despite eating food, hungerless spell, etc., without blood.
Mana-Vampirism
	Same as above, but must absorb mana to be nourished
	Does not regerate Mana points....Must absorb mana to regain.
Depression
	-10 to Attack, Gets hungry faster (10% or so), reduced saves vs 
	Justice (-20%), Reduced chance of pregnancy/fertility.  People who 
	get depressed generally have less enthusiasm about everything 
	(fighting, sex, personal property...it's all pointless anyways) and 
	tend to eat more.  (Thereby getting FAT.)
Yawns
	if you get too fatigued, you may get this disease, which is contagious.  No 
	effect other than the occassionally yawning.
Obessity
	It doesn't change your WEIGHT, per se.  It creates a unseeable undroppable 
	item of FAT for the duration of the obessity.  You can get rid of Obessity 
	with a cure disease, or by remaining hungry for a good while.  
	You contract obessity by overeatting.
Alcoholism
	If you drink too much alcohol, you risk gaining this disease.  If you don't 
	drink a glass of alcohol every 3 MUD hours, then you get a -10 to attack 
	and defense.  This penalty is cummulative until you drink alcohol, or you 
	go 5 MUD days without alcohol.  Staying logged off for 5 MUD isn't 
	suffecient....I hope.
Allergies 
	Nuff said
Insomnia



Mobs:
=====
Hydra
	Regrows 2 heads each time one is severed
	# attacks based on # of heads.
	Heads can attack different targets...Not just a tank target.
Rust Monster
	Attacks turn metal items to rust.



Group Magic:
============
The idea here is for a collection of spells that have some very miraculous effects.  There can be any number of 
restrictions on the spells.  For example, number of people, incredible amount of mana, presence of the nexus
of mana, all participants must be female, all participants must be wearing a gold ring, can only be cast on a 
specific day of the year, phase of the moon, time of day, combination of any of these, etc.  Anyhow, the caster
leads the spell and after several rounds, the effect takes place.  These are spells that only a true caster
can learn and lead.  Mages would lead Mystic Rites, Clerics lead rituals, and druids would lead a chorus in
order to achieve the effect they are going after.   group spells can change room types 
(RAISE MOUNTAINS, etc, etc.) of rooms owned by clan/caster.



Items:
======
Mana Batteries
Portable Forge
Lumberjack's saw
	1 time use item.

	One time use items, instantly slays a race the item was targeted for
	Crumbles to dust on attack, Whether strike was successful or not
Crafty bag of common skill items



High Tech:
==========
Robots/Cyborgs/Androids
Worm holes
FTL travel
Radioactivity Lots can be done with this.
Space ships/sailing ships as Locale types
Ship Dealer shopkeepers that use Space Ship templates as basis.
Create Outer Space.
Create Docking areas.
Electronic items which can be activated/deactivated, grant some affect, and use up power
Prop_TechShield that absorbs enormous damage, but like Prop_SpellReflector -- needs reset time.
Cyborgs, andriods, robots.  All basically robots....un-healable MOBS.  Must be repaired via some engineering/mechanic skill to "heal"  cyborgs, being part human part machine, have a healable portion and a non-healable portion.  different gadgets can be incorporated/plugged into these mobs and get destroyed and possibly need replacing as the mob gets damaged.  Definitely ought to be available as player characters.  Trade offs might be that they get a huge number of hit points, but can't heal....and don't get extra hitpoints as they level (except for cyborgs).  Also, possibly might not be able to "repair" themselves.
Tech armors.  Basically, an item than is a rideable version of #5.  The character must be inside/riding the vehicle in order to use.  New opportunities for player classes here (robot pilot, etc.)
FTL travel.  Some areas in space are so far apart, that they may only be reached via Faster-Than-Light travel of some sort.
Probes.  Space ships may send out probes to investigate planets, other space ships, etc.  Some probes are better than others---might not be blocked by shields, etc---cost more money, higher level, though.
