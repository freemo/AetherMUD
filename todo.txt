Scalp - Barbarian(5), Templar(10), Assassin (10), or Thief(20)
DEPRESSION.  -10 to Attack, Gets hungry faster (10% or so), reduced saves vs Justice (-20%), Reduced chance of pregnancy/fertility.  People who get depressed generally have less enthusiasm about everything (fighting, sex, personal property...it's all pointless anyways) and tend to eat more.  (Thereby getting FAT.)
YAWNS.  if you get too fatigued, you may get this disease, which is contagious.  No effect other than the occassionally yawning.
Obessity.  It doesn't change your WEIGHT, per se.  It creates a unseeable undroppable item of FAT for the duration of the obessity.  You can get rid of Obessity with a cure disease, or by remaining hungry for a good while.  You contract obessity by overeatting.
Alcoholism.  If you drink too much alcohol, you risk gaining this disease.  If you don't drink a glass of alcohol every 3 MUD hours, then you get a -10 to attack and defense.  This penalty is cummulative until you drink alcohol, or you go 5 MUD days without alcohol.  Staying logged off for 5 MUD isn't suffecient....I hope.
jewelmaking should allow you to add jewels to any item
smokable stuff, mouth position pipes, smokable resources, etc.
parse out all the commands into classes, so that access can be class based, and time req can be determined
could you expand the languages to include GOBLIN, GIANT, TERRAN (earth), AQUAN (water), IGNAN(fire), and AURIAL(air), and SYLVAN (woodland)? How much work is this?
BOOKS! paper with multiple pages to post on. Add to the papermaking skill. Also add Poster, Banner, and Screen.

msx support

From Aereon:
masonry tunnel (at about 20 levels above the normal masonry skill) connect 2 rooms in the same area that you own.
Barbarian skills (SWAMP/FOREST/PLAINS/MOUNTAINS/HILLS/DESERT) TACTICS, gives bonuses to combat in those terrains. Also allows a Barbarian to HIDE in that type of terrain if he remains in a room of that type for more than 2 minutes....
resource override parameter allows for resources to APPEAR as different names. For example ResourceOverride(berries smurfberries)
have a setting for no prompt, which also takes out the blank line after the prompt.
Commonskill Furnishing used to add descriptions to furnitures/doors. Only adds, doesn't subtract or replace. Kinda like engraving, except for furniture type items. 
blacksmith TRASHCAN. A container that has the property of trashcollection, even in a privately owned property. Anything placed in the trashcan will be destroyed in 30 minutes.
sculpt tub, jacuzzi, roman tub. Blacksmith tub. These are furnitures that hold water and people. 
Barbarian skill Smoke Signals. Requires a fire. puffs of smoke produce a message for all in the area who can read smoke signals (has smoke signal skill). To all others it says you see puffs of smoke in the air. Totally a role-playing skill. Can't think of practical use, other than communication that could be done with a tell....
Song that does the same thing as Mana Pool. Very bard-like, so it should be a lower level.
ALERTNESS skill for thieves/rangers. Automatically displays one GenWallpaper in the room at random upon entry into the room. Useful for clues. 
Another related skill could be Investigation, which does a look on all wallpapers in the room upon command.
barbarian skill GUARDTOTEM. Requires 6 scalps of the same race. Prevents creatures of that race from entering into the guarded area.should prevent only 50% of the time, reduced if the level of MOB is greater than Barbar who set the totem
Barbarian skill SCALPING, as discussed on the group....can't think of practical purposes, though....
Barbarian skill WARTOTEM. Requires 3 scalps of the same type of critter. The Barbarian drops the scalps, and does WARTOTEM command. Any critter of that race that fights in the room with the totem suffers penalties to attack and damage.
Spell Think Tank--Collective Mind--Mana Pool: all party members divide the cost of any mana consumption. IE a wizard casts a spell that costs 100 mana while partied with 3 other people, each lose 25 mana.
Barbarians should be able to LEATHERWORK the scalps into SCALP armors. SCALPS should have a value of 3 (1 better than leather, 1 worse than scales). Other than that, all scalps must be of the same critter for the purpose of leathworking a piece of armor.
Corruption - each casting reduces target alignment by target level points. evil prayer

Space ships/sailing ships as Locale types
Ship Dealer shopkeepers that use Space Ship templates as basis.
Create Outer Space.
Create Docking areas.
Electronic items which can be activated/deactivated, grant some affect, and use up power
Prop_TechShield that absorbs enormous damage, but like Prop_SpellReflector -- needs reset time.

Wild Mage: 50% of the time, a spell cast will end up higher level, different spell.
Cavelier the knight, law enforcer - mounted bonuses, Mounted Combat 2 Mounted Combat 3 Vigilance....allows the character to be on guard moreso than others...can recover hp, mana, movement at sleeping rates while resting. a skill dealing with a lance like Joust or Mounted Charge.Horsemanship.Dragon Lore.Leadership.Reputation
level and type and wear locations for weaponsmithing and armorsmithing
possible to have NE SE SW NW directions?  Yes, but StdMap and MUDGrinder would get hit hard...
LYING DOWN position?
Z-level for the GrinderMap (elevation?) how the heck would THAT work...
group formations as an alternative way of determining range
