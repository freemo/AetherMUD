4.) in 4.6.1, ive suddenly lost my changes to the default prompt 
colors.  the code ive always used is still in place, but all of the

place that i can change this?
5.)  one of my races has 4 arms and 4 hands, yet no matter which weapon 
is equipped, it seems to always be attacking with it's natural weapon.  
how do i specify to use the equipped weapon instead?

players that are inside caves and underground?

we'd need a slavetrading skill, and the ability to have the mob items "grow up" in the shopkeepers care, and we'd need some way to transfer ownership (make them serve, etc) when you buy them.
for the trader class, we need tar & feather, whip (improve common skils), torture, salvetrading skill, executions (stoning, drawn & quarter, beheading)
