61. SHOW, DISPLAY command--to show an item to a friend without giving it to him.  
 
62. WRATH command  
  1. Archon ability that reduces a character to half remaining hp, mana, and movement if you piss them off. Good for subops who don't have the full range of skills available to an archon.  
  2. Immortals and up should have a WRATH command. In another mud I play, they have that command. If a player pissed off an immortal, the got wrathed. It takes 1/2 of the player's hit points off, and emotes that they've been 'knocked out of their shoes.' When they look, turns out their shoes actually have been knocked off and they have to pick it up. Shows people not to mess with immortals and higher  
63. EMPTY command  
  1. pours out all contents in a container to the designated target. If no target is specified, then it empties to the ground. If the specified target can't hold that type of material, it dumps to the ground. If it is a liquid dumped to the ground, it is destroyed.  
 
64. GenPerfume  
  1. A GenItem that can accept an Emoter Behavior as a parameter (so that I can code recipes of perfumes into a common skill (Apothecary).)  

54. PROMPT changes  
  1. Add an option for Time of Day  
  2. Add an option for Weather  
  3. Add an option for Tank HP/MaxHP, Mana/MaxMana, Move/MaxMove  

The sage in the bazaar has much the same problem and should return the equipment that he never bothers to identify.
->The blacksmith at the bazaar should actually return the items, and possibly try and mend them.
The shipyard in the bazaar. Sells ships for 1 gold. The ships are landlocked (thus being worth about 1 gold).
Fluffy the Hampster in Animaland (Blacksmith) should return repaired objects but doesn`t.
In Animaland: The `Smelly cigars` should actually light, like cigarettes do. Found on the `Little Pigs` MOB.
