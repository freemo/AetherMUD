my rapid shot skill doesn't increase. It is a Thief 14, Arcanist 14 skill. Combining my level 2 thief with my level 30 arcanist, I have more levels than it. Is there something wrong with it? Or do I need to become a thief 14 to get it working right?

Where are some archon powers?  If some goob starts a clan called 'TulathIsAJerk', I can't delete the offending clan.
