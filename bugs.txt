prayer Feed the Dead--cast on an undead MOB, with a secondary target of a body, the undead will gain XP equal to 10*lvl of the body they consume, if body is of higher level than the undead. This way, a necromancer can make his undead more powerful (even his lowly skeletons) Should be around 10th level.

	3. Each Tax collector increases your chance of getting taxes from players.	
		1. Any MOB he walks upto he will charge. If a MOB or player can't pay, then he tries to take it out of their bank account for the bank of the tax collector's area. Once the account is depleted, then the property will go into forclosure for 6 mudmonths. If still not paid, it will go up for auction once per day for the amount owed to the tax collector. If no one bids, he waits one day before auctioning again.
		2. MOBs who can't pay the tax are pardoned. Players who can't pay the tax may be breaking the law.
	4. Any money recieved by the tax collector instantaneously goes to clan treasury.	
		1. If there is no clan treasury set up, then it stays in the tax collector's inventory.
8. Clan Smock

	Weaponsmith, Leatherworking, Tailor, Pottery, Jewel Making, Blacksmithing, 
	Scrimshaw, etc.)	
	2. Each apron has a pocket, in which items can be stored. The pocket should have 
	a HUGE carry capacity. (5000?) Any item in the pocket that can be made with that 
	skill will have a random chance of being made by the apron wearer if the 
	resources are available.	
		1. For Example, A WEAPONSMITH APRON with a knife, sword, and mace in it's 
		pocket would try to make a knife 33% of the time if there was metal available 
		on the ground. NOTE: Weaponsmith is a hard skill to get to work, since it 
		has prereqs to using (weapon specialization). On this skill, we may wish to 
		give a mob all of the specializations at 0%...
