In room New Thalos#9789 (A saltwatersurface) it does not allow you to swim west [to a shore room] (gives the --you need to swim or ride a boat that way--message). Riding a boat seems to work all of the time, though. I have tried to find out what the problem is by walking into other sea rooms (and swimming and riding a boat), but I found no correlation. 38 ) Loki       that same room (New Thalos#9789) gives the error message (You need to swim or ride a boat that way.) when you try to recall!

bug When adding new laws to page 10 (and possibly other pages) the parser erroneously places info one field short of where it should be....for example, I was trying to make it a crime to say SHIT. It put the name as warning, the flags as Swearing in Public (should have been the name), it put the Flags in the location mask field, and the justification in the Sentence field. All in all, messed up.'

Second bug. I believe Axlen had this one before.. Plinia (daughter) become a follower mob. But there's two of her. What's up with this? Anyway.. following that. I managed to get one of her arrested. The cityguard took'er into Hero territory at the top of the rainbow bridge. Not good.

In the mudgrinder, if you add the behavior EMOTER to a room (and give it valid parameters), then when you click FINISHED on the room, it will run the editroomdone.cmvp command, and result in just a white screen, without returning you to the area map (and without giving you any buttons to go anywhere).  Try on Gilligan's Island#32109 (I think).
