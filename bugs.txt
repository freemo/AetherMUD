see about shutdown problems -- havn't been able to at ALL lately.
maps are picky -- need to make them less so.
adapt Prop_Transportable to allow people to be transported when a rideable is entered.
i wonder if you couldn't do something like just making each quest require a prior one be completed
roomview should show messages from target room.
