make sure import cmare handles rooms with containers in containers with items ok
save ALL followers, including items, if possible.. if not, delete this, and do it in inventory
A young player had a follower, who had the skill kick and a decent amount of movement.  She turned off autoassist, then ordered the follower to kick a mob.  She then could order the mob to kick as often as she could type it, completely bypassing the fight delay system.
Re-conncting.  Anytime they reconnect for any reason (like link death), their followers are no longer following them, esp pets they bought or hirelings they had.  The latter is fine, but the former is a big problem.  Players with carts and horses find that their horses no longer will take their orders.
A sengir Scholar was killed by one touch of my flameshield. It just said that it warmed him, but he died
amputation does not affect wear position
i think re targeting in combat needs work
I have noticed this, Lothos has noticed it. Sometimes, at the expiration of a spell, you will suddenly die. Lothos died when his Mage armor wore off. I have died when haste wore off. The Sengir Scholar will sometimes die if you take his book away from him. I don't know what it is...maybe other affects interacting...but it is definitely a bug.
