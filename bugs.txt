GOOD EXECUTIONERS should not target anyone in your party. Period. If you wish to pass a sentence, then you must have them leave your party (ideally become a part of the executioner's party). Very annoying to be killed because you charmed a drow, or you cast SUMMON MONSTER and had to recall to stay alive....only to have Hassan kill you....
