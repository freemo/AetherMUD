10.) Now that experience is passed in a message, I presume it's possible 
to intercept it and modify now? Would it then be possible to create a 
prop for mobs and items like prop_ModExp that accepts a +/- percentage? 
For Mobs, I'm envisioning shopkeepers that can be set at -100% so they 
fight and act normal - and players can kill them if they want, but they 
do not award experience. Or even a quest only area where the mobs award 
more experience than thier level would suggest.
    For items, they could modify all experience gained when worn.
