I can add parameters thru grinder for PropDayNight and it works fine. If I go back to edit the mob the Behavior itself is still there but with no properties.  Editing the mob in-game shows the correct properties associated with the behavior.
It displays to new users (News doesn't) It displays EVERY time they login (News doesn't) they can redisplay it when needed thru a MOTD command (my players have a habit of losing equipment.. to include journals and news).
