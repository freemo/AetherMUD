Fenris, my attempt at a half-elf/demon is bugged. We have aged him for over 30 minutes as much as possible (with aid of the Butoh dance, so that`s at least twice a minute) and he hasn`t turned into a player. This is the second half demon lost.
Half the time when I sign in, I have 10 hp out of full, about 50 mv out of full, and 100 mana out of full.
I can put my armor back on after I start most dances and they don`t get stopped.
