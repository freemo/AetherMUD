save ALL followers, including items, if possible.. if not, delete this, and do it in inventory
allow duplicates of the quest to be run

	POOL will convert the room into a Water room, with 1 level of underwater added for free
	portcullis (but it requires METAL instead of stone)

1)  The way RoomForSale and subclasses intermingle regardless of LANDSELLER
and CLANDSELLER isn't a good idea (Memory is tugging that I had some
responsibility on that one).  I have it seperated out on my sys now.  (1
interface (2 lines), 3 props (3 lines each), and 1 minor set of tweaks to
StdShopkeeper)

2) Where are some archon powers?  If some goob starts a clan called
'TulathIsAJerk', I can't delete the offending clan.  Also, clandetails
should be viewable to Archons as if they are a boss for a clan (i.e. all
members, applicants, etc).  It would also be nice to be able to manually
authorize a clan to active.
protected citizen needs a wander parm.
