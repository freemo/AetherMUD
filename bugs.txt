Don't know how many emotes there are for the kid.. but just as some ideas.. I'd like.. if I drop him.. He cries.. or if anyone else but the parents hold the kid for like.. so long.. it cries for it's parents.. and I think it'd also be cool.. if after a year old.. it not only cries for them.. but cries out, Momma or Dadda . It'd also be cool if the baby emoted stuff like, wiggles their toes. or makes a spit bubble. you know.. those stupid things parents get over excited about. 7  ) Sendasien  Oh Oh! and what about, chews on their finger. holds up a finger. cries for no reason. streches. makes baby noises. Just things.. to always remind the parent they have a baby. The more the baby does.. the more fun!! :D I love you guys!That babies will cry for their fathers too!!Oh oh! What about the babies.. falling asleep ..maybe they coudl even wake up crying.. or.. just.. wake up.. that'd be fun too
Don't know if I ideaed this before or not.. but pregnant women to gain weight?
