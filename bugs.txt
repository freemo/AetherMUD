GridTest#0 I made into a 5x5 WoodsGrid, and linked to it's east another 
5x5 WoodsGrid. 

I then created a single WoodRoom and deleted all exits to it so it was an 
unlinked room. 

Then, from the far southwest corner of GridTest#0 I did a 'link GridTest#2 
south' which created the link to the single room. 

Reboot, and now the grid room is not linked to the WoodRoom anymore. 
The single WoodRoom still has a link to the grid though, to the correct child room (GridTest#0#(0,4)).
