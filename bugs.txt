webmacro SHUTDOWN Allow an Admin to Shutdown the server without having to be logged  into the game.
webmacro SHUTDOWN RESTART Same reason as above, if somethings wrong with the game but your not  on the host pc and you believe the problem could be fixed by a quick  reboot this will be handy without having to log into the game (maybe  the game isnt accepting connections, i.e. you wouldnt be able to log  in anyway)
webmacro ANNOUNCE Make announcements without having to log into the game, makes it  easier then having to log in and dealing with player pages etc. if  you just need to make a quick announcement.
webmacro DUMPFILE To view some text file on your computer through the MUD without  having to log on or ebing on the host PC.
webmacro LIST Maybe a system for the command LIST, wouldnt be as easy implemented  as some of the above (SHUTDOWN for example could just be a button on  a .cmvp page)


!OK....now I have seen it all. Myrddhin has just use floating disc to float a ton of armor nearby, to gain benefits from it all.
leash in mobile broke
!wimpy behavior -race +dwarf zappercheck (very?) broken -- should have protected dwarves from fighting each other
you can not deposit a container with contents in it. (According to badmonkey--the actual typo said I HATE HAVING TO DEPOSIT A PACK OF THIRTY THINGS SEPERATELY.)
!sounders should have triggers for damage and starting a fight.
!Follower allows a mob to follow someone who enters the room and meets the appropriate masks. For ex..gnome slave has a willfollow towards -race +gnome +player.
!skillaggressive makes mob aggressive if they see you using a particular skill, or under the effect of a particular skill.
!Prop_HaveEnabler, Prop_WearEnabler, Prop_RideEnabler
!Herbology -- might pull its herb from the secret identity, allow herb choices based on domain types
Prop_ClosedNightDay gets seasonal stuff

In the mudgrinder, if you add the behavior EMOTER to a room (and give it valid parameters), then when you click FINISHED on the room, it will run the editroomdone.cmvp command, and result in just a white screen, without returning you to the area map (and without giving you any buttons to go anywhere).  Try on Gilligan's Island#32109 (I think).
