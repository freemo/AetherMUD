protected list in arrest is broke
save ALL followers, including items, if possible.. if not, delete this, and do it in inventory

partitions as arbitrary areas
Masonry	POOL will convert the room into a Water room, with 1 level of underwater added for free
Masonry	portcullis (but it requires METAL instead of stone)
allow guildmasters and clan bosses to do enchanters
Arrest to dos:	deal with officernames, judgenames, jail rooms, release rooms
Where are some archon powers?  If some goob starts a clan called 'TulathIsAJerk', I can't delete the offending clan.  Also, clandetails should be viewable to Archons as if they are a boss for a clan (i.e. all members, applicants, etc).  It would also be nice to be able to manually authorize a clan to active.
gain list should do qual
