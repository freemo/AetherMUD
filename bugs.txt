When I create an item and set gettable to be false. I attempt to place it on to a table, or in to a container. It says that it is being placed in to the container, but when I look at the table or container its not there. Then when I type look to look at the room, it is there on the ground.
test prop_retainable
!arrest -- don't allow assault and murder for same person
!arrest -- only one resisting arrest!
test combatabilities wand use... interesting
test mobeater behavior
!fix the mob autolooting thing -- it's WAY broke
!split doesn't respect all group members
!combat prowess, that's not a bad idea... drop the players overall attack value and keep it the same for both attacks when using two weapons. 
?Ra has been using breath attacks, but not have sent out damage messages to me. I don't know if there is a bug with Ra or with breath weapons. Ra is in olympus, I believe. it comes out Ra the Sun God blasts a frozen cone of frost from his mouth!   avoids the Dragonbreath from you. Note, the avoids statement is on a seperate line, and has a space before avoids. A different message appears if he messus up the attack. The frost is sometimes replaced by fire/lightning/acid.
!I think you should strip the quotes on 'guest door'.
