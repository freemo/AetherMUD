Ask Loki which guildmaster -- might be dup behavior -- When I gain a skill, it adds the skill to my list, removes the train, tells me the guildmaster teaches me the skill, and then the guildmaster says that I already know the skill. That last part is the bug. He just taught me the skill, but then tells me I already know it.
