Stonewalking 	While in a cave, stone, or mountain -type room, the Delver is intangible and undetectable until he attacks or gets an item. 
Drifting 	This is a levitate that allows the delver to move along the ceiling of a cave (reverse gravity). Outside, it should make the delver fall up. While drifting, the delver can only move at crawl speeds. This is similar to beholders and grells movement abilities.

Some solution for variable eq on mobs -- use rejuv! 
	But how to edit?! mobs with this kind of eq sort it out when entering a room with player or entered by player.
	But how/when to set the "examine me later" flag?
Blood should act as a cure light wounds to a vampire. that is...if a blood resource is drunk by a vampire, he should regain some hit points.
Why do I need to stand to embroider? I would think it's easier to do it sitting down!
