I turned smurfette into a statue, and then cast Acid Fog. It tells me Someone sizzles in the acid fog , even though noone else is here. (Loki looked, he saw smurfette's statue and smurfette, since she is petrified). The bug is: statue characters shouldn't take damage from area affect spells.
When Increase Gravity is revoked, I still can't move afterward. Neither can anyone else in my party.
