prayer Feed the Dead--cast on an undead MOB, with a secondary target of a body, the undead will gain XP equal to 10*lvl of the body they consume, if body is of higher level than the undead. This way, a necromancer can make his undead more powerful (even his lowly skeletons) Should be around 10th level.
1. Behavior: Conquest		
	1. This behavior will make an area conquerable by a clan	
		1. An area that is already controlled by a clan cannot be conquered without declaring WAR on that clan first.
	2. Once per MUDhour, the conquest behavior will tick. At this time it checks several factors:	
		1. It checks to see if any Clan has a higher number of total CONTROLPOINTS than the combined inhabitants of the area.
		2. If one or more clans have exceded point 1, then the area is considered conquered by the clan with the highest value (in control points).
	3. Earn taxes from players	
		1. It would be nice to earn from MOBs as well, but I don't know how this could be done effectively.
		2. MOBs are taxed too, but own no property, and don't break the law if they can't pay.
	4. You should earn some XP each time you conquer an area (but only once per day per area).	
		1. Experience earned this way is based on the HIGHEST level MOB in the area (maybe worth twice the amount of killing the highest MOB in the area).
		2. This XP is given to ALL clan members who are in the area at the time of conquest. It is not clan XP.
4. Attittude		
	1. This is the populations overall attittude about their current leadership, and is controlled by the conquest behavior.	
	2. Attittude is a score based on the number of MOBs in the area. Initially, a neutral attittude is set for a conquered area of 3*number of MOBs in the area. A high number is synomonous with revolution, while a low number indicates complacency.
		1. A modifier of 5*(15-Governer's CHA) applies once a governor is assigned.
	1. Only the governor with the highes level applies to any Governor checks.	
			2. A modifier of (Highest Inhabitant LVL-Governor's LVL) applies, once a governor is selected.
			3. A modifier of 25*(1-(CP/total inhabitant lvls)) is calculated every time the conquest behavior updates.
			4. A modifier of +1 per MOB assigned a WORK task.
			5. A modifier for other tasks may apply, as well as from skills/spells/prayers/chants/songs.
			6. A modifier of +3 is applied every time an inhabitant is killed.
	1. Bo---This is for realism (no one likes an unsafe neighborhood), and it creates instability in lower level areas, because the newbies keep killing off the smurfs, creating unrest.	
		3. If the area gets to a negative score, the leader gains XP based on the number of MOBs in the area and how negative the score is every time the area updates. (never more than 100 XP). You only get this XP if you are logged on when the area updates.	
Conquest Items   (Edit)

Once the account is depleted, then the property will go into forclosure for 6 mudmonths. If still not paid, it will go up for auction once per day for the amount owed to the tax collector. If no one bids, he waits one day before auctioning again.

		1. For Example, A WEAPONSMITH APRON with a knife, sword, and mace in it's pocket would try to make a knife 33% of the time if there was metal available on the ground. NOTE: Weaponsmith is a hard skill to get to work, since it has prereqs to using (weapon specialization). On this skill, we may wish to give a mob all of the specializations at 0%...
	
Conquest Concepts   (Edit)	
1. Inhabitant		
	1. An inhabitant is any MOB native to that area.	
2. Citizen

4. Clan Logo		
	1. This is akin to the DESCRIPTION command for a character. Each clan can create a short logo (40 characters) to represent their clan. For example, "A Black Eagle" could be your logo.
