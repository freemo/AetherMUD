MPECHO $%GSTAT($n STRENGTH)% This gives me the STRENGTH value however I have been unable to transfer that value into a variable with: MPSETVAR $n HOLD $%GSTAT($n STRENGTH)% If I check the value of hold I have "GSTAT(playnername" not the actual value.
I'm also trying to update the player stat with: MPGSET $n STRENGTH 100
