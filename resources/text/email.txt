We supports email!  By having a player in this mud, you automatically 
have an email address that is like playername@domain.  Giving us a real email address 
besides will allow you to have your player email forwarded to you (but only
from other players).  Giving a real email address also allows you to retreive
your password if you forget it.  Your real address is kept secret, of course, hidden
behind the player email address mentioned above.
