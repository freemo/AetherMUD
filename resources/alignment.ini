# The INI file specifies all settings for the faction

# Name is what the player will see in their faction listings.
# It is also used for easy editing of which mobs a faction belongs to.
NAME=Alignment

# MINIMUM / MAXIMUM are the low / high values one can achieve
# While traditionally the scale was a 1000 point system, going
# to a larger system can allow for a more gradual approach.
# Negatives, positives, zeros are all OK here.
MINIMUM=-100000
MAXIMUM=100000

# DEFAULT is a semi-colon delimited set of Zappers and values
# Ex: -10000 -RACE +DWARF; 10000 -RACE +ELF; 0

# RATEMODIFIER - This one's tough to explain.
# Go with 0.0001 for 6 digit range values,
# Go with 0.001 for less that 6 digit values.

# Faction Ranges
# This is used when the user is listing what standing they have
# with a given faction.
#   [Short Name] is the term is used by zappers
#   [Align Flag] is in case the faction is being used as an alignment
#                replacement.
# RANGEX = [low], [high], [name] ; [short name]; [align flag]

# Relationships with other factions
# Any faction change affecting this faction will affect all the
# ones listed here.  The % sets how much so, positively or negatively.
# RELATIONX = [Faction] [x.xx%]/[-x.xx%]

# Change Triggers, the meat of the beast.  What will change faction?
# 0) Types can be MURDER, the Ability ID, or either TYPE_DESC or
# FLAG_DESC values (as listed in the Ability interface).  This means
# you can say “FLAG_HEALING” if you want ANY healing abilities to initiate this change.
# 
# 1) The Directions:
#   a. UP – Faction increases regardless of the faction of the target
#   b. DOWN – Faction decreases regardless of the faction of the target
#   c. OPPOSITE – explained above
#   d. MINIMUM – the player INSTANTLY gets the lowest possible faction
#   e. MAXIMUM – the player instantly gets the highest possible faction
# 
# 2) Change factor – a multiplier for the change.  This can be used for major/minor infractions..
# 
# 3) ANY Flag – An example to clarify.  The ‘Order of Death’ faction despises all healers.
# They don’t care who you heal – if you heal, you lose faction with them.  So, the line for
# that could be like “CHANGE5=FLAG_HEALING;DOWN;500%;ANY;SELF;”.  Without the ANY flag, any
# change events only take place if the source and the target BOTH have some standing with
# the faction in question.
# 
# 4) SELF flag.  If the change event should trigger on any action that is targeting the source.
# This is not recommended because someone can just spam their faction in one direction or another.
# 
# 5) Zapper string.  You can specify a filter for change events.  So, in
# “#CHANGE3=Prayer_Bless;UP;100%;ANY;;-RACE +RODENT”, anytime a player with the
#  Alignment faction blesses a mob with the Rodent race, their faction will go up.
# This change will not trigger if cast on a human.
# CHANGEX = [TYPE];[DIRECTION];[FACTOR %];[ANY];[SELF];[ZAPPER]
