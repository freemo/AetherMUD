# String translation definition file
# The purpose of this file is to 
#
# There are two separate sections in this file
# [session-translation]
#    This is the primary string mapping that is processed by
#    the translation engine before it goes through the CoffeeMud
#    filtration process.
# [filter-translation]
#    During the filtration process, certain codes may be replaced
#    with hard-coded english words.  This short section is to 
#    handle those words specifically.
# [final-translation]
#    After the string has gone through session translation and 
#    filter-translation, it will finally be parsed by the definitions
#    in this section to catch any stray strings which may have gotten
#    through the first two.
#
# At the moment, there are only two commands defined for each section:
# replace "regular expression pattern" with "replacement pattern"
#    This command will search for the given reguar expression pattern in
#    the string.  If it is found, the string following the with clause 
#    will be used to change the string to something else.  Regular 
#    expressions are exactly as they are defined in the Java API.
#    Replacement expressions may include literals, or a slash followed
#    by a number to insert Java "capturing groups" from the search
#    expression.  The double quotes around the expressions are required.
#    You may escape a quote with a backslash to include it in your expressions.
# define "variable string" as "replacement string"
#    This command is used to define strings which will be replaced inside of
#    other commands.  A variable definition will apply only to the section in
#    which it is defined.  The replacement will be applied to both expressions
#    and replacement strings in the REPLACE command, as well as in the 
#    replacement string of other DEFINE commands.  This command may be placed
#    before the first section to make it "global" to all sections.
