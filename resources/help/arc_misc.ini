Description: \n\r\
This is an archon skill to assist in determining if a set of players who \
are connected from the same ip address are the same person.  It does \
this by tracking certain pieces of data which together may be taken \

of the numbers are as follows:\n\r\
SYNC - The number of commands entered by more than one member of an IP group \
within a single 4 second period. \n\r\
SPEECH - This refers to SAY commands, broken into three sections.  The \
first number represents the number of SAY commands done in the same room \
with a player who has the same IP address.  The second number represents \
the number of SAY commands directed at another player.  The last number \
is the number of SAY commands total.\n\r\
SOCIALS - These are also divided into three numbers where, again, the \
first is the number of socials in the same room with a player with the \
same IP, the second being socials directed at another player, and the \
last being the number of total socials.\n\r\
CMD - The number of commands entered which are different than the previous \
command entered.\n\r\
ORDER - The number of times one of the players in the group gave an ORDER \
to another player in the group.  A sure sign indeed.

SECURITY=\
SECURITY in CoffeeMud is on a player by player basis.  \n\r\
SYSOP status is defined as the ultimate security to do \
anything, anywhere, at any time.  Access to all commands in all areas will \
be available.  SYSOP status is defined in the CoffeeMud ini file entry SYSOPMASK \
which establishes the player characteristics that designate SYSOPS. \
All players who meet the requirements of the mask are automatically \
SYSOPS.\n\r\
\n\r\
Players who are not SYSOPS may also be granted specific privileges.  Each \
of the privileges may be limited to specific areas, or available globally. \
Privileges are defined in the Security section of a players settings.  Each \
security code listed for a player may be either a list of security Groups, or \
a specific security code.\n\r\
\n\r\
Security GROUPS are also defined in the ini file.  A Security GROUP \
consists of a group name, and a set of strings or codes representing privileges for \
that group.  Each group is prefixed in the INI file with the "GROUP_".  However, \
you should not use the "GROUP_" when adding group priviledges to the Security \
field of a player.  For instance, if you have "GROUP_BUILDER" defined in the \
INI file, then you would add "BUILDER" to Security when modifying a player in \
order to make that user part of the BUILDER group.  The security codes which make \
up each group are implicitly global, but can be qualified as area-only using the \
keyword "AREA".\n\r\
\n\r\
The following are the default strings or codes which, when found in a players \
security settings or in a group definition, confer the listed privileges. \
Each of these settings may be entered as listed below, or prefixed with the \
word "AREA" followed by a space, followed by the key.  This has the effect of \
making that privilege only available in or at areas where the Player is listed \
in the areas "Staff" setting.  For example, the security code "ANNOUNCE" by itself \
confers the global ability to use the ANNOUNCE command.  The security code \
"AREA ANNOUNCE" means that the ANNOUNCE command can only be used inside areas \
where the player is listed as Staff.\n\r\
