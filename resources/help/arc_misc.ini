SECURITY=\
SECURITY in CoffeeMud is on a player by player basis.  \n\r\
SYSOP status is defined as the ultimate security to do \
anything, anywhere, at any time.  Access to all commands in all areas will \
be available.  SYSOP status is defined in the CoffeeMud ini file entry SYSOPMASK \
which establishes the player characteristics that designate SYSOPS. \
All players who meet the requirements of the mask are automatically \
SYSOPS.\n\r\
\n\r\
Players who are not SYSOPS may also be granted specific privileges.  Each \
of the privileges may be limited to specific areas, or available globally. \
Privileges are defined in the Security section of a players settings.  Each \
security code listed for a player may be either a list of security Groups, or \
a specific security code.\n\r\
\n\r\
Security GROUPS are also defined in the ini file.  A Security GROUP \
consists of a group name, and a set of strings or codes representing privileges for \
that group.  Each code in each group is implicitly global, but can be \
qualified as area-only using the keyword "AREA".\n\r\
\n\r\
The following are the default strings or codes which, when found in a players \
security settings or in a group definition, confer the listed privileges. \
Each of these settings may be entered as listed below, or prefixed with the \
word "AREA" followed by a space, followed by the key.  This has the effect of \
making that privilege only available in or at areas where the Player is listed \
in the areas "Staff" setting.  For example, the security code "ANNOUNCE" by itself \
confers the global ability to use the ANNOUNCE command.  The security code \
"AREA ANNOUNCE" means that the ANNOUNCE command can only be used inside areas \
where the player is listed as Staff.\n\r\
