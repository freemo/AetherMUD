PROP_STATTRAINER=\
Property   : Prop_StatTrainer\n\r\
Targets    : MOB\n\r\
Parameters : \n\r\
Example    : \n\r\
Description: \n\r\
Makes a mob suitable for training character statistics, by setting all \
statistics to 25.

PROP_TATTOO=\
Property   : Prop_Tattoo\n\r\
Targets    : MOB\n\r\
Parameters : tattoo names delimited by semicolons\n\r\
Example    : ;UNDEADKILLER;MANLYMEN;\n\r\
Description: \n\r\
This property is used to give MOBs tattoos.  They are stored as abilities \
instead of affects, unlike the other Properties! Tattoo's are intended to \
act as miscellaneous flags which players may obtain, not unlike a quest point.  \
These tattoo's can then be checked for as requirements to enter rooms or exits, \
or to possess certain items. \
\n\r\
An example would be like this:  The completion of a specific quest occurs when \
Gunther defeats the evil sorcerer Nunder and enters his inner chamber (where all \
the treasure is hidden).  Entering this inner chamber automatically grants Gunther \
a Tatto called "NUNDERKILLER".  Now, elsewhere in the realm is the second quest \
where Nunder's apprentice has escaped with an ancient artifact and is up to \
no good.  However, to even ENTER the area where Nunder's apprentice is operating, \
the system (via the Prop_ReqTattoo property on this other Area) requires that \
Gunther already have the "NUNDERKILLER" Tattoo.  If Gunther had not defeated \
Nunder and obtained the "NUNDERKILLER" Tattoo, he would not be allowed into \
the realm of Nunder's apprentice.
