The months are divided into four seasons, with Winter running from month \
12 through month 2, Spring from 3 through 5, Summer from 6 through 8, \
and Fall from 9 through 11.

CLASS=Try HELP FIGHTER, THIEF, BARD, CLERIC, MAGE, or DRUID.
FIGHTER=\
Fighters are brutish weapon masters, skilled in the art of killing.  They may \
specialize in any weapon type, and learn numerous new fighting techniques as \
they advance in level.  Fighters receive more hit points and attack bonuses \
per level than any other class, and are invaluable in a close melee.\
\n\r\
Fighter is the starting point for numerous sub-classes which the player \
may choose to gain levels in at any time.  These sub-classes include: \
Monk, Ranger, Paladin, and Barbarian.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: The fighters strength is in his domination of pure combat. \
When playing alone, a fighter is fully capable of gaining the necessary \
experience.  However, the fighter may choose to lead a group to gain an \
even greater advantage.  As the tank (primary melee combatant) in a group, \
the fighter will give the group the benefit of his superior armor and fighting \
skill, while benefitting from the healing spells of a cleric, or the magical \
aids of a mage.\
\n\r\n\r\
The fighters greatest weakness is his inability to move secretly, or get into \
or out of tricky spots.  For this reason, the fighter outside of a group \
should steer towards simple combat areas, and be content only with the \
treasures obtains from his kills.\n\r

THIEF=\Thieves are skillful, sly, and devious. They may only use daggers \
and swords, and may only wear leather armor at best.  However, they come \
with numerous skills allowing them to survive in the dog-eat-dog world, \
including swiping and stealing; hiding, peeking, and sneaking; trapping, \
poisoning, and many others.  Thieves also qualify for many devious fighting abilities.\
\n\r\
Thief is the starting point for numerous sub-classes which the player \
may choose to gain levels in at any time.  These sub-classes include: \
Assassin, Arcanist (Arcane Rougue), Burglar, and Trapper.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: The thieves strength is in his ability to obtain money, and in his \
ability to navigate tricky situations.  By accumulating the wealth of others, \
the thief can stay comfortably equipped with the latest and best money can buy. \
When playing alone, the thief thrives as the only class able to get into and \
out of any secret place without stirring up unnecessary trouble.  Although \
not generally appreciated in groups, a group benefits from these skills, as \
well as the thiefs unique ability to deliver enormous amounts of backstab \
damage.\
\n\r\n\r\
The thief is only moderately skilled at combat, but can make up for it by \
using his wealth to obtain favors, good equipment, and the necessary potions \
and scrolls necessary to survive the experience gaining battles.\n\r

DRUID=\
Druids are mystical guardians of the natural world, and the wielders \
of natures grandest powers.  They may not wear metal, and can only use a \
small set of natural weapons, but their notorious health and magical chants \
more than make up for this.  Like the natural world, Druids are restricted \
to a neutral alignment.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: The druid is the most complex class to play.  Most of his magic \
requires the assistance of numerous spells to bear fruit, but the benefits make \
the complexity well worth it.  The druid is also best fit for travelling with \
animal armies of his own creation.  In groups, the druid can assist with some \
extra fire power at high levels.  For the most part though, it is alone that \
the druid will flourish, forming his own animal groups to make up for his \
weakness in combat.\
\n\r\n\r\
Although weak in melee combat, due to equipment and skill limitations, the \
druid is capable of marshaling a the powers of animals and plants to aid in \
the vanquishing of foes for experience.  At higher levels, as the powers of \
weather come into play, the Druid will find their magical prowess unequaled \
by any other class.

BARD=\
Bards are traveling singers, whose "songs" can possess powerful magic.  \
They are highly desired group members for the inspiration they bring to \
their team members, and the great stings they provide to their enemies.  \
They possess the same weapon and armor restrictions as thieves, but \
also qualify for many thief skills.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: The great strength of the bard is in his wide assortment of \
skills, and in his powerful songs.  The bard may try his hand as the lonesome \
travellor, but will find his skills still put him behind his peers.  It is \
in the company of other, more powerful classes, that the bard will flourish. \
And because of the unique nature of his magic, and how his songs will always \
affect groups, groups will always want to have a bard along.\
\n\r\n\r\
Bards are as weak as thieves in combat, and lack their general sneakiness, \
so in the company of others must the bard find his path to greatness, \
filling any skill gaps in almost any group with the appropriate magic or \
ability.\n\r

CLERIC=\
Clerics are the great vassels of the Gods.  Through \
them the wonders of both good and evil are possible.  Clerics possess \
great magical abilities in their numerous "prayers".  While their weapon \
choices are limited to their alignment, they may wear any type of armor.\
\n\r\
The Cleric is the general of priests, appeasing all the gods equally, \
or choosing to focus on one at his whim.  However, should the cleric \
wish to show true devotion, he can gain levels in specialist classes \
which may or may not be available to him, depending on his disposition. \
These classes include: Templar, Shaman, Doomsayer, Necromancer, \
Missionary, Purist, Healer, or Oracle.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: The first, last, and greatest strength of the good Cleric is in \
his ability to heal, just as the ability to harm aids the evil Cleric.  A Cleric \
is unique in his ability to flourish either alone or in groups, being moderately \
skilled in combat, and having the healing ability to last a long time in a \
tough fight.  Clerics are highly desired for groups, however, as the lead \
fighter in the group will want the Cleric's healing touch in battle.\
\n\r\n\r\
The only weakness of the Cleric is offensively, which the evil Cleric will \
make up for with harmful magic, and the good Cleric will compensate for with \
healing spells to last out the battle.  With a balanced approach, the Cleric \
can gain experience with the efficiency of a fighter.\n\r

MAGE=\
Mages are masters of magic, and wielders of the great elemental powers.  \
While weak in hit points and in fighting skill, their spells are the most \
widely prized and powerful of all the classes.  They may not wear any metal \
or leather armors, or use most weapons.  However, the sting of their magic \
missiles and the armor of magic they wear makes up for any loss.\
\n\r\
Mage is the basis for numerous sub-classes which the player \
may choose to gain levels in at any time.  These sub-classes include: \
Abjurer, Alterer, Conjurer, Diviner, Enchanter, Evoker, Illusionist, \
and Transmuter.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: Mages are easily the most versatile of classes, being able to make \
spell choices which carve out the path the Mage would like to take.  For the \
loner Mage, the emphasis on offensive magic will make him a powerful opponent in \
battle.  In groups, the mage may focus on protective magic to make him a more \
desirable companion.  And even the playful mage may focus on the role-playing \
magic to make his mudding as fun as possible!\
\n\r\n\r\
The mage is almost useless in weapon combat.  The mage must be smart and \
creative to use his spells to give him the edge.  But the versatility of the \
mage gives him the ability to do just that, using magic and guile to trick \
monsters to their death, granting experience for the mage.\n\r

PALADIN=\
Paladins are holy fighters, possessing many of the traits of both Fighters \
and Clerics, though in less intensity than either class alone.  They may \
learn Cleric spells at higher levels, and possess numerous fighting techniques.  \
Their weapons and armor choices are unlimited, but Paladins are restricted \
to a good alignment.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: Paladin's have the potential of being the most powerful of classes, \
and the most desired of group members.  Their powerful combat skills and auras \
of power make them the perfect tanks for groups, especially since their Cleric \
healing abilities can allow them to fill this gap in a group.  Alone, they can \
also flourish, vanquishing evil with the efficiency of the fighter.\
\n\r\n\r\
The only weakness of the Paladin is his reliance on goodness.  In most muds, \
this limits his adventuring choices greatly.  However, his strengths for \
lasting and winning in combat are so broad, he will quickly advance.\n\r

RANGER=\
Rangers are noted primarily for their ability to track their friends and \
enemies, though their knowledge of the natural world has also given them \
great magical strength.  They are a cross between the fighter and the druid, \
gaining druid chants at higher levels, and numerous fighting techniques.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: Rangers can provide a unique opportunity for experience advancement \
in a mud.  Their combat skills make them desirable as group members as tanks. \
Their ability to use scrolls gives them access to magic that grants them some \
of the mages versatility.  Meanwhile, the druidic chants they learn gives them \
a unique affinity with animals, allowing them to form their own groups as well.\
\n\r\n\r\
The Ranger, like the Paladin, is not quite as strong a fighter as a pure \
fighter, but makes up for this using his magical animal affinity.  Also, the \
Ranger will have to be careful to maintain a neutral alignment in order for \
the druidic chants to become useful.  In the meantime, the ranger must use \
scrolls and other magical items to supplement his natural fighting skill.\n\r

BARBARIAN=\
Barbarians are the wild warriors of the frontier.  Their ability to deal \
large amounts of damage in combat, as well as inspire combative behaviors \
in others makes them especially ferocious.  They are fond of mastering \
numerous weapons, and building up their bodies, though they distrust \
metal armors, and may not wear them without difficulties.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: Barbarian combat skills make them desirable as group members. \
While their non-metal armor restriction can sometimes hurt their nomination \
as tanks, their ability to deal and absorb large amounts of damage can \
more than make up for anything lacked.  Because of this, the Barbarian \
flourishes as well alone as in groups.\
\n\r\n\r\
The Barbarian is every bit as strong a fighter as a pure Fighter, and has \
that extra combative edge that many players look for in a Class.  Players \
who dislike subtelty and enjoy straight up hack-and-slash playing will \
enjoy the Barbarian's simple destructive style.\n\r

ABJURER=\
Abjurers are specialist mages who concentrate their studies towards the \
mastery of protective magic.  So adept have they become that they \
automatically gain every known abjuration spell when they gain levels, \
including spells which only the abjurer may master. \
\n\r\
Although the Abjurer will not have the benefit of Enchantment spells, \
they are still formidible foes.  Their protective magic lasts much \
longer than that of other mages, and they still have access to many \
of the most dangerous spells.\n\r

ALTERER=\
Alterers are specialist mages who concentrate their studies in the \
mastery of altering the world around them.  Their all-purpose skills \
serve them wonderfully in combat, in the maintenance of their own \
health and equipment, and in becomming successful adventurers.  So \
skilled are they in the alteration of the universe that they gain \
all known alteration spells, including some which only the alterer \
may gain.\
\n\r\
The Alterer suffers from a lack of access to the Evocation \
school of magic, the long duration and heavy impact of their \
spells plus the general usefulness of their school makes them a \
good choice for all mages.  Since they have their own kind of \
destructive magic, they will find they don't miss evocations at \
all.\n\r

CONJURER=\
Conjurers are specialist mages who concentrate their studies in the \
matery of movement.  They are adept at transporting themselves and \
other creatures, as well as items and entire armies with their \
powerful spells.  So adept are they at conjuration that they gain \
all known conjuration spells, including some which only the conjurers \
may understand.\
\n\r\
The Conjurer may lack Transmutation abilities, but he does not miss \
that strange magic.  After all, it's always better to be yourself, \
whereever you might find yourself.\n\r
 
DIVINER=\
Diviners are specialist mages who have mastered the arts of unconvering \
secrets, and obtaining knowledge.  The entire world is an open book for \
them, just waiting for the pages to be turned.  So adept do these mages \
become at divination that they gain all known divination spells, \
including some which are even secrets to the other mages!\
\n\r\
The Diviner's love of knowledge means he loses the knack of casting \
spells of illusion.  However, they make up for this by being the most \
popular of advisors and group members when strange and amazing \
treasures are uncovered, or some secret needs to be told.\n\r

ENCHANTER=\
Enchanters are specialist mages who can always seem to bring out the \
best magical aspects of whoever or whatever they turn their attention \
to.  And when angered, the Enchanter can also twist their enemies \
to their will.  So adept are they at this art of change that they \
gain all known enchantment spells, even those which only the enchanter \
may learn.\
\n\r\
Enchanters love change so much that they neglect the protective \
magic of abjuration, and find themselves unable to use that magic.  \
However, the Enchanter does not fear the snake's poison, or the \
dragon's breath, especially when he can snap his fingers and make \
them both his pets!\n\r

EVOKER=\
Evokers are specialist mages who can bring from nothing the powers \
of light and darkness, heat and cold, lightning and ferocious wind.  \
So adept are these mages are the creation of these magical elements \
that they automatically gain all evocation/invocation spells, even \
those known only to evokers.\
\n\r\
Evokers are so impatient to create from nothing that they have neglected \
the study of the alteration of already existing things, and will find \
themselves unable to use alteration magic.  However, the Evoker is the horror \
of all specialist mages, death in both fingers, and is envied by all for \
his power.\n\r

ILLUSIONIST=\
Illusionists are specialist mages who have mastered the art of deception \
and illusion.  They can make anyone believe anything, and can fool the \
senses into believing whatever they wish.  Illusionists are sly and \
playful, and so adept at their art that they gain all known illusion \
spells, even those known only to illusionists.\
\n\r\
So lost in their dreamworld is the Illusionist, that he forgets what \
is true, and finds himself unable to remember his divination spells.  \
However, the Illusionist is the greatest and most fun of the social \
mages, with a nice mix of defensive magic that can save him in times \
of need.\n\r

TRANSMUTER=\
Transmuters are specialist mages who can transform the likeness and \
composition of anyone they touch.  Transmutation is the most feared \
of magics, and the Transmuter is so skilled at his art that he gains \
all known transmutation spells automatically, including the most \
secret and ugly of spells only the specialist may learn.\
\n\r\
Transmuters care nothing for conjuration, and so they soon neglect \
that kind of magic, being more fascinated with the many shapes of \
things right here at home.  Although the Evoker believes himself \
the king of specialists with his harmful beams, the Transmuter is \
the most feared and hated of specialists for the terrible \
and awesome consequences of his spells.\n\r

MONK=\
Monks are the agile and graceful masters of their own bodies.  Combining quick \
reflexes with intense study of the martial arts makes them a powerful and \
intimidating opponent.  Although Monks may use weapons, most of their power \
and unique ability comes when they are completely unarmed.  And since they \
depend so heavily on their agility, they will find themselves wearing only \
leather and other light armors.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: Either alone or in groups, the Monk is a dizzying class to play. \
Capable of more pure attacks than any other class, and loaded down with \
dozens of Monk-specific physical feats makes the Monk almost mage-like \
in complexity.  In fact, the player who loathes worrying about staying \
up-to-date on equipment, but who enjoys the pure fight may be especially \
attracted to Monk.\
\n\r\n\r\
Like all fighters, the Monk will gain experience principally through the \
vanquishing of foes.  Although the armor restriction can seem daunting, the \
Monks extra dexterity bonus to armor, and the wide variety of attacks and \
defences makes them every bit as powerful (if not much more) than the other \
fighter classes.\n\r

DOOMSAYER=\
Doomsayers are very special servants of the gods, whose proclaimations \
of fire and brimstone give them resistance to fire attacks, as well \
as special powers controlling it.  The Doomsayer is an evil aligned \
class, meaning that he will always fumble on good prayers, and does \
not qualify for good prayers.  However, the Doomsayer can use many \
dangerous edged weapons, any kind of armor, and gets numerous \
special prayers that only the doomsayer can claim. \
\n\r

NECROMANCER=\
Necromancers are the dark lovers of death and the dead, serving the gods \
in this special and little appreciated realm.  The Necromancer is an evil \
aligned class, meaning that he will always fumble on good prayers, and does \
not qualify for good prayers.  However, the Necromancer can use many \
dangerous edged weapons, any kind of armor, and gets numerous \
special prayers known only to the Necromancer, such as the ability to \
animate all kinds of wicked undead, even at low levels. Eventually, the \
Necromancer may even become a Lich himself! \
\n\r

PURIST=\
Purists are the idyllic representatives of the goodness of divinity.  They \
are so strict in their goodness that they seem to many cold and unyielding. \
This nature is so ingrained, in fact, that the purist gains many cold and \
cold-based attacks and defensive prayers.  This includes special powers \
over water and purity.  The Purist is a good aligned class, meaning that \
he always fumble evil prayers. \
\n\r

MISSIONARY=\
Missionaries are the crusading adventurers for the gods, exploring and \
spreading the good word of their deity far and wide.  So energetic and mobile \
are the Missionaries that they seem like the wind, and in fact gain many \
powers of wind and electricity.  The Missionary is a neutral aligned \
class. \
\n\r

HEALER=\
Healers project the most benevolent aspects of their gods by bringing \
life and good health to those around them.  The Healer is so adept at \
these arts that his or her healing prayers are more powerful than those \
cast by any other cleric.  The Healer is a good aligned class, meaning that \
he will always fumble on evil prayers, and does not qualify for evil \
prayers.  The Healer also gets a few special prayers known only to \
the Healer, including the great Aura of Healing at 30th level. \
\n\r

ORACLE=\
Oracles are those who seek the infinite wisdom of their god, forver probing \
the vastness of divine knowledge.  So knowledgable are the Oracles that they \
actually begin to gain arcane divination spells in addition to their \
assortment of prayers.  The Oracle, being a seeker of truth and knowledge, is \
a good aligned class, meaning that they will always fumble evil prayers, and do \
not qualify for them.  Beyond 30th level, the Oracle begins to gain skills from \
other classes previously unknown to him, as the mysteries of the universe begin \
to be revealed. \
\n\r

SHAMAN=\
Shaman are those who worship the gods in the most primitive and basic \
ways of the earth.  The Shaman is thus granted special powers over the \
earth by the gods, including resistances to acid attacks, at the expense \
of vulnerability to electricity.  The Shaman is a neutral \
aligned class, meaning that he will never fumble on neutral prayers, and \
has a much smaller fumble chance on good and evil prayers.  The Shaman \
is restricted to blunt weapons, any kind of armor, and gets numerous \
special prayers known only to Shaman. \
\n\r

TEMPLAR=\
Templar are those who pursue power and glory in the name of their god.  They \
are the great weaponmasters, wielding their arms to conquer the world in \
their gods name.  The Templar can use any weapons and armor, and \
can specialize in many weapons as they increase in levels.  The Templar is \
an evil aligned class, meaning that they always fumble on good prayers, and \
do not gain any good prayers.  However, their Aura of Strife, and their \
increased number of attacks makes them a formidable foe of all who \
oppose the will of their god. \
\n\r

ASSASSIN=\
Assassins reflect the darkest and most wicked side of the rougue.  The dealing \
of death becomes a goal in itself, the epitomy of evil.  The assassin becomes \
so centered on this art that he begins to slow his pace, learning and \
contemplating each "mark" as the best method of killing them becomes clear.  \
They also learn skills in keeping track of and tracking down their marks, as \
well as other means of making life for the targeted miserable, and short. \
The assassin can use any weapons, unlike the standard thief, though his armor \
is still restricted. 

ARCANIST=\
Also known as the Arcane Rougue, the Arcanist is the thief who has become \
fascinated with all things arcane, but has little or no innate magical power. \
He is an accumulator of wands and scrolls; making good \
use of his limited knowledge to create, improve, and most especially use \
these items to his devious ends.  Arcanists are also just knowledgable enough \
to learn spells simply by observing their usage, although, lacking any innate \
power, he forgets them as soon as they are used.

BURGLAR=\
The burglar is the thief who has made the accumulation of wealth and power \
his center of being, to the detriment of all else.  The taking of the property \
of others by stealth, wits, or even charm makes him the bane of the rich and \
lawful alike.  This most purist of thieves also has superior skill at being \
undetected in the performance of these dastardly deeds, though he stands \
at a slight disadvantage to better trained thieves if caught.  

TRAPPER=\
The trapper, possibly the most cowardly of thieves, has spent late nights \
tinkering with springs and switches, learning to kill indirectly through \
the devices of his art.  Trappers also view fauna as means to his ends, \
accumulating animals both live and dead with amazing efficiency.  Trappers \
alone have the greatest access to the most deadly traps, as well as \
exclusive access to skills that turn animals into his own personal play \
things, whether it be as items of sale, or as trained devilish pets.

GOOD=ALIGNMENT
EVIL=ALIGNMENT
NEUTRAL=ALIGNMENT
ALIGNMENT=\
Your alignment represents your moral fiber, with Good representing selfless benevolence, \
Evil representing selfish maliciousness, and Neutral representing the balance of the two. \
\n\r\n\r\
In combat, the amount of experience you receive from the vanquishing of a foe depends partially \
on your alignment versus that of the creature you have killed.  In general, if you are Good and \
you kill a Good creature, or Evil and kill an Evil creature, or Neutral and kill a Neutral \
creature, you receive NO experience.  The amount of experience can vary depending upon how close \
to perfect Goodness, perfect Evil, or pure Neutrality you are.  In addition to receiving no \
experience for violating this rule, you will find your characters alignment slowly changing with \
each repeat offense. \n\r\
\n\r\
For some classes, alignment can have other affects.  Paladins must always be good, and will find \
that their spellcasting ability disappears with their goodness.  Clerics may be good or evil, but \
their spell choices can profoundly impact their alignment.  A Good Cleric or Paladin who casts \
malicious spells will soon find themselves becoming evil.  Evil Clerics can suffer the same fate \
for using benevolent spells.

RACE=Try HELP DWARF, ELF, GNOME, HALFELF, HALFLING, or HUMAN.
DWARF=\
Dwarves are shorter than humans, but much stockier, and enjoy sporting beards (including the \
women).  They receive one bonus Constitution point, but lose one Charisma point.  They also \
have Infravision, or the ability to see other creatures in the dark.  Dwarves are natural \
Miners, though their class choices will be limited.

ELF=\
Elves are slightly shorter and more slender than humans, but are quick and agile.  They \
receive one bonus Dexterity point, but lose one Constitution point. Elves have Infravision, \
are skilled at Foraging. Though their class choices are more limited than humans, \
they have the broadest choices of all demi-humans.

GNOME=\
Gnomes are curious and quick-witted folk, resembling small dwarves.  They receive one bonus \
Intelligence point, but lose one Wisdom point due to their carelessness.  They also have \
Infravision, are skilled at Gem Digging, though their class choices will be limited.

HALFELF=\
Half Elves are a mixture of humans and elves, possing human drive and elven grace.  \
They have Infravision, are skilled Fishermen, and have almost as many class choices \
as normal Humans.

HALFLING=\
Halflings are a very short fur-footed folk.  They receive one bonus Dexterity \
point, but lose one point of Strength.  They have Infravision, make excellent Cooks, \
though their class choices will be limited.

HUMAN=\
Just like you and me!  Humans are versatile and successful adventurers.  They receive \
2 bonus training points at first level, make powerful lumberjacks.  Humans also have \
the broadest class choices.

PETS=Players, especially at lower levels, may wish to purchase or charm animals or \
other creatures to follow them.  These creatures are called pets, and will usually \
assist the player in combat.  This can aid a player who has trouble surviving, though \
pets will also siphon off some experience the player would otherwise receive alone. \
Rangers and Druids adventuring with pets are not hindered in this way, however.
