CONQUEST=\
One or more areas in the realm may be designated as conquerable by clans. \n\r\
\n\r\
To conquer an area, or even to discover if an area CAN be conquered, the \
clan must use the Clan Crafting skill to construct a clan Flag.  The Flag must \
then be dropped into any room in the area.  Doing so will tell you if the \
area is conquerable, who controls it if anyone, how many CONTROL POINTS \
are required to control the area, and how many control points any warring \
clans may presently have in the area.  An area not currently controlled by \
any clan may freely be conquered.  An area already controlled by a clan may \
only be conquered by a rival clan if that clan has properly declared War.\n\r\
\n\r\
The clan Flag is the most important item in Conquest.  The Flag must be on \
the ground in order for any clan to score control points in an area, or to \
even maintain control once the area has been conquered.  If there is not at \
least one Flag on the ground, a conquered area will revert to neutral status.  \
Luckily, any resident citizens in the same room as a conquerer's flag will tend to guard \
the flag from thieves.  Also, Flags can only be removed by a member of the \
clan whose flag it is, or by a rival clan who has properly declared War.\n\r\
\n\r\
Once a flag has been laid down, the clan whose flag it is may LOOK at the flag \
at any time to see the status of their conquest; i.e. the number of control points \
they have scored, and how many they must score to complete the conquest.  A \
control point is scored whenever a resident mob of that area is killed, or \
forced (via charm or other methods) to follow a member of the conquering clan. \
Control points awarded are equal to the level of the mob killed or charmed. \
Control points will also fade over time, to reflect a restoration of order in the \
area.\n\r\
\n\r\
If an area is already under the control of a clan, the resident mobs will \
resist invasion by rivals.  Once an area is conquered, however, all resident \
mobs will instantly disavow any previous controlling clan, drop any clan items \
they may be carrying, and swear allegiance to the conquering clan.  At this \
point, any clan members who are designated as having conquerers privileges may \
ORDER any member of the area to do anything they like.  Control points become \
irrelevant to the conquerers once control is established.\n\r\
\n\r\
A conquered area benefits greatly from items created using Clan Crafting.  These \
items can be crafted by a designated Enchanter, given sufficient materials \
and clan experience.  Clan items can be captured for additional clan experience \
by rival clans who have properly declared war. The types and functions \
of clan items include:\n\r\
\n\r\
Law Book - These must be constructed inside the area for which the book is \
intended.  It will allow a properly privileged clan member to read and modify \
numerous aspects of law and order in the area, including the location of jails, \
the types of laws, and the duration of punishments.\n\r\
\n\r\
Guardbanner - These can be given to mobs in a conquered area to designate them \
as deputys of the area, who are authorized to enforce laws and arrest lawbreakers.\n\r\
\n\r\
Judges Gavel - This can be given to a mob in a conquered area to designate him \
as the judge of the area, authorizing him to deal out punishments like parole, \
jail time, or death.\n\r\
\n\r\
Pamphlet - These can be given to mobs conquered by RIVAL clans to make them \
disloyal to the conquering clan, and loyal to the clan who made the pamphlet. \
Pamphlets will have a tendency to spread over time, and will make the holders \
easier to conquer via the ORDER command (see charming for control points above).\n\r\
\n\r\
Gathering items - Items such as the Miners Pick and Foragers Basket can be given \
to mobs to make them work for the clan, performing the Common skill associated \
with the item.\n\r\
\n\r\
Crafting items - Items such as the Tailors Needle and Potters Wheel can be given \
to mobs to make them craft items for the clan, performing the Common skill \
associated with the item.  These mobs can be given example items to use as \
templates for what they will attempt to make, or they can be given nothing to \
make them craft items at random.  For the skill to work, the mob must not have \
anything in its inventory to confuse the skill, such as a Blacksmith item \
holder carrying some smurfberries.  Also, the holder must have the correct resource \
and sufficient quantity in the room to work from.\n\r\
\n\r\
Executioners Scales - This item makes the mob a tenacious attacker of evil \
mobs and thieves.\n\r\
\n\r\
Scavengers Sticker - This item makes the mob a scavenger, picking anything up \
they find on the ground.\n\r\
\n\r\
Tax Collectors Clipboard - This item makes the mob a collector of tax money from \
anyone who is not also a member of their clan.\n\r\
\n\r\

CLAN=CLANS
CLANS=\
Clans are a group of players banded together for some common purpose, or due to \
common lineage or fellowship.  \
Clans are created using the CLANCREATE command, \
and listed using CLANLIST.  Members apply to clans using CLANAPPLY, and are \
either accepted by the clan using CLANACCEPT or rejected using CLANREJECT, \
after listing the applicants names using CLANDETAILS. \
Bosses can set up autorejecting qualifications to the clan using CLANQUAL. \
Once accepted, members can be removed using CLANEXILE or promoted to other \
offices using CLANASSIGN.  Members can leave on their own using CLANNRESIGN. \
Offices like Treasurers can deal with \
special Clan bankers on their Clans behalf.  Members can \
cast "Clan Donate" to their clans after the boss has used CLANDONATESET to set a \
donation room for their clan.  Members can share their experience points \
with the clan if the bosses have set up an experience tax rate using CLANTAX. \
Members also have access to the spell "Clan Home" \
which they can use to recall to the room set by the boss using CLANHOMESET. \
Clan activity is very important.  If the minimum number of members is not \
maintained, then pending or inactive clans may be deleted by the system. \
Once there are several active clans, the bosses may use CLANDECLARE to \
declare relations between their clan and others.\n\r\
\n\r\
There are four different types of clans:\n\r\
\n\r\
CLAN - The traditional Clan is an efficient organization run by a single boss. \
The boss has all the powers and authority mentioned above, and can assign \
leaders, treasurers, or staff to assist with some menial clan chores.  Clan bosses \
and leaders also have the authority to maintain discipline in the ranks using \
the ORDER command.\n\r\
\n\r\
GUILD - The Guild is run by several elite members called Guildmasters.  These \
guildmasters reserve many tasks for themselves, though they must often vote \
amongst themselves on matters affecting the good of the whole clan.  The \
guild is very hierarchical, so that those with rank above the others may \
use the ORDER command to those below to maintain discipline.  They may \
also assign a treasurer to help them handle money, though like the CLAN, the \
masters of the guild also reserve that authority as well.\n\r\
\n\r\
UNION - The Union is a clan where all members can vote to elect Senators to \
handle important decisions such as membership, interclan relations, and \
setting clan polity.  The Senators, like the Guildmasters in a guild, must \
vote amongst themselves on these matters.  All the union members may also \
vote to elect secretaries to handle clan property, treasurers \
to take care of money, and sheriffs to take care of military matters. \
In a Union, there are no members who may use the ORDER command on other \
members.\n\r\
\n\r\
FELLOWSHIP - The Fellowship is a clan where all members vote on any and \
all clan related matters.  Interclan relations, membership, elections to \
office, and clan policy are able to be placed to the vote of the entire \
membership by any member at any time.  For safety, only two powers are \
reserved to clan offices: the power to withdraw from the clan bank account is \
given only to the Treasurer, and the power to maintain clan property is given \
only to the Manager.  Soldiers may also be appointed to handle military \
matters out in the field.

TIME=\
Time in CoffeeMud is divided into 16 "hours", each of which is about \
10 real minutes long.  Hours in CoffeeMud are numbered from 0-15. \
Dawn is at hour 0, dusk is at hour 12, and night runs from hours 13-15. \
There are 30 mud "days" to each month, and 12 mud "months" to each year. \
The months are divided into four seasons, with Winter running from month \
12 through month 2, Spring from 3 through 5, Summer from 6 through 8, \
and Fall from 9 through 11.

CLASS=Try HELP FIGHTER, THIEF, BARD, CLERIC, MAGE, or DRUID.
FIGHTER=\
Fighters are brutish weapon masters, skilled in the art of killing.  They may \
specialize in any weapon type, and learn numerous new fighting techniques as \
they advance in level.  Fighters receive more hit points and attack bonuses \
per level than any other class, and are invaluable in a close melee.\
\n\r\n\r\
Fighter is the starting point for numerous sub-classes which the player \
may choose to gain levels in at any time.  These sub-classes include: \
Monk, Ranger, Paladin, and Barbarian.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: The fighters strength is in his domination of pure combat. \
When playing alone, a fighter is fully capable of gaining the necessary \
experience.  However, the fighter may choose to lead a group to gain an \
even greater advantage.  As the tank (primary melee combatant) in a group, \
the fighter will give the group the benefit of his superior armor and fighting \
skill, while benefitting from the healing spells of a cleric, or the magical \
aids of a mage.\
\n\r\n\r\
The fighters greatest weakness is his inability to move secretly, or get into \
or out of tricky spots.  For this reason, the fighter outside of a group \
should steer towards simple combat areas, and be content only with the \
treasures obtains from his kills.\n\r

THIEF=\Thieves are skillful, sly, and devious. They may only use daggers \
and swords, and may only wear leather armor at best.  However, they come \
with numerous skills allowing them to survive in the dog-eat-dog world, \
including swiping and stealing; hiding, peeking, and sneaking; trapping, \
poisoning, and many others.  Thieves also qualify for many devious fighting abilities.\
\n\r\n\r\
Thief is the starting point for numerous sub-classes which the player \
may choose to gain levels in at any time.  These sub-classes include: \
Assassin, Arcanist (Arcane Rougue), Burglar, and Trapper.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: The thieves strength is in his ability to obtain money, and in his \
ability to navigate tricky situations.  By accumulating the wealth of others, \
the thief can stay comfortably equipped with the latest and best money can buy. \
When playing alone, the thief thrives as the only class able to get into and \
out of any secret place without stirring up unnecessary trouble.  Although \
not generally appreciated in groups, a group benefits from these skills, as \
well as the thiefs unique ability to deliver enormous amounts of backstab \
damage.\
\n\r\n\r\
The thief is only moderately skilled at combat, but can make up for it by \
using his wealth to obtain favors, good equipment, and the necessary potions \
and scrolls necessary to survive the experience gaining battles.\n\r

DRUID=\
Druids are mystical guardians of the natural world, and the wielders \
of natures grandest powers.  They may not wear metal, and can only use a \
small set of natural weapons, but their notorious health and magical chants \
more than make up for this.  Like the natural world, Druids are restricted \
to a neutral alignment.\
\n\r\n\r\
Druid is the starting point for numerous sub-classes which the player \
may choose to gain levels in at any time.  These sub-classes include: \
Beastmaster, Gaian, and SkyWatcher.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: The druid is the most complex class to play.  Most of his magic \
requires the assistance of numerous spells to bear fruit, but the benefits make \
the complexity well worth it.  The druid is also best fit for travelling with \
animal armies of his own creation.  In groups, the druid can assist with some \
extra fire power at high levels.  For the most part though, it is alone that \
the druid will flourish, forming his own animal groups to make up for his \
weakness in combat.\
\n\r\n\r\
Although weak in melee combat, due to equipment and skill limitations, the druid \
is capable of marshaling a the powers of animals and plants to aid in the vanquishing \
of foes for experience.  At higher levels, as the powers of weather come into play, \
the Druid will find their magical prowess unequaled by any other class.

BEASTMASTER=\
Like Tarzan or Grizzly Adams, the BeastMaster is the lord of his particular \
jungle, being both the guardian and master steward of the animal kingdom. \
Unlike the other druids then, the beastmaster takes great pride in his \
animal changing abilities, and receives many more animal forms as he \
progresses in level.  The beastmaster is also more accutely aware of the \
dangers of the wild, and is thus a much more physical and able fighter \
than other druids tend to me.  

GAIAN=\
The Gaian is the druid of the green earth, watching over the plants, trees \
and all growing things.  The gaian has a very special relationship with the \
plants and trees, having special abilities to make almost any location \
he steps into a santuary for his leafed friends.  So in tune with green \
things is the gaian that sunlight can actually give his green tinted skin \
additional powers.  The gaian can also call on the plants and trees around \
him to aid in him combat, to hide him from foes, or even to provide him with \
the things one would normally have to seek civilization for.  

SKYWATCHER=\
The SkyWatcher is the master druid of the stars and heavens, being the \
very powerful steward of the great wheel in the sky.  The SkyWatcher \
maintains a special connection with the moon, and gains numerous special \
abilities to summon great powers from luna.  So connected is he to the \
moon that his strength and powers will fluxuate during the month, following \
the phase of the moon.  A master of wind and weather, the SkyWatcher is also \
very capable of bringing the heavens down upon his enemies at need.

BARD=\
Bards are traveling singers, whose "songs" can possess powerful magic.  \
They are highly desired group members for the inspiration they bring to \
their team members, and the great stings they provide to their enemies.  \
They possess the same weapon and armor restrictions as thieves, but \
also qualify for many thief skills.\
\n\r\n\r\
Bard is the basis for numerous sub-classes which the player \
may choose to gain levels in at any time.  These sub-classes include \
the Charlatan, Prancer, Minstrel, and the Jester.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: The great strength of the bard is in his wide assortment of \
skills, and in his powerful songs.  The bard may try his hand as the lonesome \
travellor, but will find his skills still put him behind his peers.  It is \
in the company of other, more powerful classes, that the bard will flourish. \
And because of the unique nature of his magic, and how his skills will always \
affect groups, that groups will always want to have a bard along.\
\n\r\n\r\
Bards are as weak as thieves in combat, and lack their general sneakiness, \
so in the company of others must the bard find his path to greatness, \
filling any skill gaps in almost any group with the appropriate magic or \
ability.\n\r

CHARLATAN=\
The Charlatan is the master of deception and disguise.  Grouped with the \
Bards because of his natural acting ability, as well as his highly social \
nature, the Charlatan can be quite antisocial if he chooses.  \
\n\r\n\r\
The Charlatan is also a natural spy in muds with numerous players, and has \
an extremely wide assortment of skills.  More than any other class, the \
Charlatan can taste the powers of all other classes, sometimes with real \
skill, and sometimes only in seeming.

MINSTREL=\
The Minstrel is the master of instruments and musical tools.  So capable is \
a minstrel in this art that he or she is able to draw forth magical and \
wonderous powers from the instruments played.  The Minstrel is able to \
craft and draw unique powers from any of dozens of different musical \
instruments, with the only drawback being how the chosen instrument \
impacts fighting or speaking ability while it is being played.\
\n\r\n\r\
The Minstrel is as social of a bard as the others, but due to his many hours \
of lonely practice, the Minstrel also has an almost arcane like ability to \
use instrumental magic for more solitary or unique benefits the simple Bard \
or Prancer.  In the end, the Minstrel may become an orchestra of power unto \
himself, capable of bringing tremendous benefit and joy to his group, or \
terrible retribution to his foes.

PRANCER=\
The Prancer is the graceful master of dance, who entertains and leads others \
in the joyous and powerful maneuvers of his craft.  Like the Bard, the Prancer \
is a highly desired group member for his "group affecting" skills, which include \
the magical dances in which he specializes.\
\n\r\n\r\
Prancers also gain a select set of powerful fighter skills to prove the worth of \
his diligence in maintaining his body.  

JESTER=\
The Jester is the joking, annoying, and sneaky fellow that few Bards like to \
claim.  Like the Charlatan, they remain associated with Bards due to their \
highly social nature and their charismatic attitudes.  The Jester is also \
amazingly dextrous and slipperty, due to the slapstick style of maneuvers \
he practices and specializes in.  \
\n\r\n\r\
As the levels progress, however, few could argue the seriousness of the \
Jesters power, should his goofy smile, for some reason, be turned around.

CLERIC=\
Clerics are the great vassels of the Gods.  Through \
them the wonders of both good and evil are possible.  Clerics possess \
great magical abilities in their numerous "prayers".  While their weapon \
choices are limited to their alignment, they may wear any type of armor.\
\n\r\n\r\
The Cleric is the general of priests, appeasing all the gods equally, \
or choosing to focus on one at his whim.  However, should the cleric \
wish to show true devotion, he can gain levels in specialist classes \
which may or may not be available to him, depending on his disposition. \
These classes include: Templar, Shaman, Doomsayer, Necromancer, \
Missionary, Purist, Healer, or Oracle.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: The first, last, and greatest strength of the good Cleric is in \
his ability to heal, just as the ability to harm aids the evil Cleric.  A Cleric \
is unique in his ability to flourish either alone or in groups, being moderately \
skilled in combat, and having the healing ability to last a long time in a \
tough fight.  Clerics are highly desired for groups, however, as the lead \
fighter in the group will want the Cleric's healing touch in battle.\
\n\r\n\r\
The only weakness of the Cleric is offensively, which the evil Cleric will \
make up for with harmful magic, and the good Cleric will compensate for with \
healing spells to last out the battle.  With a balanced approach, the Cleric \
can gain experience with the efficiency of a fighter.\n\r

MAGE=\
Mages are masters of magic, and wielders of the great elemental powers.  \
While weak in hit points and in fighting skill, their spells are the most \
widely prized and powerful of all the classes.  They may not wear any metal \
or leather armors, or use most weapons.  However, the sting of their magic \
missiles and the armor of magic they wear makes up for any loss.\
\n\r\n\r\
Mage is the basis for numerous sub-classes which the player \
may choose to gain levels in at any time.  These sub-classes include: \
Abjurer, Alterer, Conjurer, Diviner, Enchanter, Evoker, Illusionist, \
and Transmuter.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: Mages are easily the most versatile of classes, being able to make \
spell choices which carve out the path the Mage would like to take.  For the \
loner Mage, the emphasis on offensive magic will make him a powerful opponent in \
battle.  In groups, the mage may focus on protective magic to make him a more \
desirable companion.  And even the playful mage may focus on the role-playing \
magic to make his mudding as fun as possible!\
\n\r\n\r\
The mage is almost useless in weapon combat.  The mage must be smart and \
creative to use his spells to give him the edge.  But the versatility of the \
mage gives him the ability to do just that, using magic and guile to trick \
monsters to their death, granting experience for the mage.\n\r

PALADIN=\
Paladins are holy fighters, possessing many of the traits of both Fighters \
and Clerics, though in less intensity than either class alone.  They may \
learn Cleric spells at higher levels, and possess numerous fighting techniques.  \
Their weapons and armor choices are unlimited, but Paladins are restricted \
to a good alignment.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: Paladin's have the potential of being the most powerful of classes, \
and the most desired of group members.  Their powerful combat skills and auras \
of power make them the perfect tanks for groups, especially since their Cleric \
healing abilities can allow them to fill this gap in a group.  Alone, they can \
also flourish, vanquishing evil with the efficiency of the fighter.\
\n\r\n\r\
The only weakness of the Paladin is his reliance on goodness.  In most muds, \
this limits his adventuring choices greatly.  However, his strengths for \
lasting and winning in combat are so broad, he will quickly advance.\n\r

RANGER=\
Rangers are noted primarily for their ability to track their friends and \
enemies, though their knowledge of the natural world has also given them \
great magical strength.  They are a cross between the fighter and the druid, \
gaining druid chants at higher levels, and numerous fighting techniques.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: Rangers can provide a unique opportunity for experience advancement \
in a mud.  Their combat skills make them desirable as group members as tanks. \
Their ability to use scrolls gives them access to magic that grants them some \
of the mages versatility.  Meanwhile, the druidic chants they learn gives them \
a unique affinity with animals, allowing them to form their own groups as well.\
\n\r\n\r\
The Ranger, like the Paladin, is not quite as strong a fighter as a pure \
fighter, but makes up for this using his magical animal affinity.  Also, the \
Ranger will have to be careful to maintain a neutral alignment in order for \
the druidic chants to become useful.  In the meantime, the ranger must use \
scrolls and other magical items to supplement his natural fighting skill.\n\r

BARBARIAN=\
Barbarians are the wild warriors of the frontier.  Their ability to deal \
large amounts of damage in combat, as well as inspire combative behaviors \
in others makes them especially ferocious.  They are fond of mastering \
numerous weapons, and building up their bodies, though they distrust \
metal armors, and may not wear them without difficulties.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: Barbarian combat skills make them desirable as group members. \
While their non-metal armor restriction can sometimes hurt their nomination \
as tanks, their ability to deal and absorb large amounts of damage can \
more than make up for anything lacked.  Because of this, the Barbarian \
flourishes as well alone as in groups.\
\n\r\n\r\
The Barbarian is every bit as strong a fighter as a pure Fighter, and has \
that extra combative edge that many players look for in a Class.  Players \
who dislike subtelty and enjoy straight up hack-and-slash playing will \
enjoy the Barbarian's simple destructive style.\n\r

ABJURER=\
Abjurers are specialist mages who concentrate their studies towards the \
mastery of protective magic.  So adept have they become that they \
automatically gain every known abjuration spell when they gain levels, \
including spells which only the abjurer may master. \
\n\r\n\r\
Although the Abjurer will not have the benefit of Enchantment spells, \
they are still formidible foes.  Their protective magic lasts much \
longer than that of other mages, and they still have access to many \
of the most dangerous spells.\n\r

ALTERER=\
Alterers are specialist mages who concentrate their studies in the \
mastery of altering the world around them.  Their all-purpose skills \
serve them wonderfully in combat, in the maintenance of their own \
health and equipment, and in becomming successful adventurers.  So \
skilled are they in the alteration of the universe that they gain \
all known alteration spells, including some which only the alterer \
may gain.\
\n\r\n\r\
The Alterer suffers from a lack of access to the Evocation \
school of magic, the long duration and heavy impact of their \
spells plus the general usefulness of their school makes them a \
good choice for all mages.  Since they have their own kind of \
destructive magic, they will find they don't miss evocations at \
all.\n\r

CONJURER=\
Conjurers are specialist mages who concentrate their studies in the \
matery of movement.  They are adept at transporting themselves and \
other creatures, as well as items and entire armies with their \
powerful spells.  So adept are they at conjuration that they gain \
all known conjuration spells, including some which only the conjurers \
may understand.\
\n\r\n\r\
The Conjurer may lack Transmutation abilities, but he does not miss \
that strange magic.  After all, it's always better to be yourself, \
whereever you might find yourself.\n\r
 
DIVINER=\
Diviners are specialist mages who have mastered the arts of unconvering \
secrets, and obtaining knowledge.  The entire world is an open book for \
them, just waiting for the pages to be turned.  So adept do these mages \
become at divination that they gain all known divination spells, \
including some which are even secrets to the other mages!\
\n\r\n\r\
The Diviner's love of knowledge means he loses the knack of casting \
spells of illusion.  However, they make up for this by being the most \
popular of advisors and group members when strange and amazing \
treasures are uncovered, or some secret needs to be told.\n\r

ENCHANTER=\
Enchanters are specialist mages who can always seem to bring out the \
best magical aspects of whoever or whatever they turn their attention \
to.  And when angered, the Enchanter can also twist their enemies \
to their will.  So adept are they at this art of change that they \
gain all known enchantment spells, even those which only the enchanter \
may learn.\
\n\r\n\r\
Enchanters love change so much that they neglect the protective \
magic of abjuration, and find themselves unable to use that magic.  \
However, the Enchanter does not fear the snake's poison, or the \
dragon's breath, especially when he can snap his fingers and make \
them both his pets!\n\r

EVOKER=\
Evokers are specialist mages who can bring from nothing the powers \
of light and darkness, heat and cold, lightning and ferocious wind.  \
So adept are these mages are the creation of these magical elements \
that they automatically gain all evocation/invocation spells, even \
those known only to evokers.\
\n\r\n\r\
Evokers are so impatient to create from nothing that they have neglected \
the study of the alteration of already existing things, and will find \
themselves unable to use alteration magic.  However, the Evoker is the horror \
of all specialist mages, death in both fingers, and is envied by all for \
his power.\n\r

ILLUSIONIST=\
Illusionists are specialist mages who have mastered the art of deception \
and illusion.  They can make anyone believe anything, and can fool the \
senses into believing whatever they wish.  Illusionists are sly and \
playful, and so adept at their art that they gain all known illusion \
spells, even those known only to illusionists.\
\n\r\n\r\
So lost in their dreamworld is the Illusionist, that he forgets what \
is true, and finds himself unable to remember his divination spells.  \
However, the Illusionist is the greatest and most fun of the social \
mages, with a nice mix of defensive magic that can save him in times \
of need.\n\r

TRANSMUTER=\
Transmuters are specialist mages who can transform the likeness and \
composition of anyone they touch.  Transmutation is the most feared \
of magics, and the Transmuter is so skilled at his art that he gains \
all known transmutation spells automatically, including the most \
secret and ugly of spells only the specialist may learn.\
\n\r\n\r\
Transmuters care nothing for conjuration, and so they soon neglect \
that kind of magic, being more fascinated with the many shapes of \
things right here at home.  Although the Evoker believes himself \
the king of specialists with his harmful beams, the Transmuter is \
the most feared and hated of specialists for the terrible \
and awesome consequences of his spells.\n\r

MONK=\
Monks are the agile and graceful masters of their own bodies.  Combining quick \
reflexes with intense study of the martial arts makes them a powerful and \
intimidating opponent.  Although Monks may use weapons, most of their power \
and unique ability comes when they are completely unarmed.  And since they \
depend so heavily on their agility, they will find themselves wearing only \
leather and other light armors.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: Either alone or in groups, the Monk is a dizzying class to play. \
Capable of more pure attacks than any other class, and loaded down with \
dozens of Monk-specific physical feats makes the Monk almost mage-like \
in complexity.  In fact, the player who loathes worrying about staying \
up-to-date on equipment, but who enjoys the pure fight may be especially \
attracted to Monk.\
\n\r\n\r\
Like all fighters, the Monk will gain experience principally through the \
vanquishing of foes.  Although the armor restriction can seem daunting, the \
Monks extra dexterity bonus to armor, and the wide variety of attacks and \
defences makes them every bit as powerful (if not much more) than the other \
fighter classes.\n\r

DOOMSAYER=\
Doomsayers are very special servants of the gods, whose proclaimations \
of fire and brimstone give them resistance to fire attacks, as well \
as special powers controlling it.  The Doomsayer is an evil aligned \
class, meaning that he will always fumble on good prayers, and does \
not qualify for good prayers.  However, the Doomsayer can use many \
dangerous edged weapons, any kind of armor, and gets numerous \
special prayers that only the doomsayer can claim. \
\n\r

NECROMANCER=\
Necromancers are the dark lovers of death and the dead, serving the gods \
in this special and little appreciated realm.  The Necromancer is an evil \
aligned class, meaning that he will always fumble on good prayers, and does \
not qualify for good prayers.  However, the Necromancer can use many \
dangerous edged weapons, any kind of armor, and gets numerous \
special prayers known only to the Necromancer, such as the ability to \
animate all kinds of wicked undead, even at low levels. Eventually, the \
Necromancer may even become a Lich himself! \
\n\r

PURIST=\
Purists are the idyllic representatives of the goodness of divinity.  They \
are so strict in their goodness that they seem to many cold and unyielding. \
This nature is so ingrained, in fact, that the purist gains many cold and \
cold-based attacks and defensive prayers.  This includes special powers \
over water and purity.  The Purist is a good aligned class, meaning that \
he always fumble evil prayers. \
\n\r

MISSIONARY=\
Missionaries are the crusading adventurers for the gods, exploring and \
spreading the good word of their deity far and wide.  So energetic and mobile \
are the Missionaries that they seem like the wind, and in fact gain many \
powers of wind and electricity.  The Missionary is a neutral aligned \
class. \
\n\r

HEALER=\
Healers project the most benevolent aspects of their gods by bringing \
life and good health to those around them.  The Healer is so adept at \
these arts that his or her healing prayers are more powerful than those \
cast by any other cleric.  The Healer is a good aligned class, meaning that \
he will always fumble on evil prayers, and does not qualify for evil \
prayers.  The Healer also gets a few special prayers known only to \
the Healer, including the great Aura of Healing at 30th level. \
\n\r

ORACLE=\
Oracles are those who seek the infinite wisdom of their god, forver probing \
the vastness of divine knowledge.  So knowledgable are the Oracles that they \
actually begin to gain arcane divination spells in addition to their \
assortment of prayers.  The Oracle, being a seeker of truth and knowledge, is \
a good aligned class, meaning that they will always fumble evil prayers, and do \
not qualify for them.  Beyond 30th level, the Oracle begins to gain skills from \
other classes previously unknown to him, as the mysteries of the universe begin \
to be revealed. \
\n\r

SHAMAN=\
Shaman are those who worship the gods in the most primitive and basic \
ways of the earth.  The Shaman is thus granted special powers over the \
earth by the gods, including resistances to acid attacks, at the expense \
of vulnerability to electricity.  The Shaman is a neutral \
aligned class, meaning that he will never fumble on neutral prayers, and \
has a much smaller fumble chance on good and evil prayers.  The Shaman \
is restricted to blunt weapons, any kind of armor, and gets numerous \
special prayers known only to Shaman. \
\n\r

TEMPLAR=\
Templar are those who pursue power and glory in the name of their god.  They \
are the great weaponmasters, wielding their arms to conquer the world in \
their gods name.  The Templar can use any weapons and armor, and \
can specialize in many weapons as they increase in levels.  The Templar is \
an evil aligned class, meaning that they always fumble on good prayers, and \
do not gain any good prayers.  However, their Aura of Strife, and their \
increased number of attacks makes them a formidable foe of all who \
oppose the will of their god. \
\n\r

ASSASSIN=\
Assassins reflect the darkest and most wicked side of the rougue.  The dealing \
of death becomes a goal in itself, the epitomy of evil.  The assassin becomes \
so centered on this art that he begins to slow his pace, learning and \
contemplating each "mark" as the best method of killing them becomes clear.  \
They also learn skills in keeping track of and tracking down their marks, as \
well as other means of making life for the targeted miserable, and short. \
The assassin can use any weapons, unlike the standard thief, though his armor \
is still restricted. 

ARCANIST=\
Also known as the Arcane Rougue, the Arcanist is the thief who has become \
fascinated with all things arcane, but has little or no innate magical power. \
He is an accumulator of wands and scrolls; making good \
use of his limited knowledge to create, improve, and most especially use \
these items to his devious ends.  Arcanists are also just knowledgable enough \
to learn spells simply by observing their usage, although, lacking any innate \
power, he forgets them as soon as they are used.

BURGLAR=\
The burglar is the thief who has made the accumulation of wealth and power \
his center of being, to the detriment of all else.  The taking of the property \
of others by stealth, wits, or even charm makes him the bane of the rich and \
lawful alike.  This most purist of thieves also has superior skill at being \
undetected in the performance of these dastardly deeds, though he stands \
at a slight disadvantage to better trained thieves if caught.  

TRAPPER=\
The trapper, possibly the most cowardly of thieves, has spent late nights \
tinkering with springs and switches, learning to kill indirectly through \
the devices of his art.  Trappers also view fauna as means to his ends, \
accumulating animals both live and dead with amazing efficiency.  Trappers \
alone have the greatest access to the most deadly traps, as well as \
exclusive access to skills that turn animals into his own personal play \
things, whether it be as items of sale, or as trained devilish pets.

GOOD=ALIGNMENT
EVIL=ALIGNMENT
NEUTRAL=ALIGNMENT
ALIGNMENT=\
Your alignment represents your moral fiber, with Good representing selfless benevolence, \
Evil representing selfish maliciousness, and Neutral representing the balance of the two. \
\n\r\n\r\
In combat, the amount of experience you receive from the vanquishing of a foe depends partially \
on your alignment versus that of the creature you have killed.  In general, if you are Good and \
you kill a Good creature, or Evil and kill an Evil creature, or Neutral and kill a Neutral \
creature, you receive NO experience.  The amount of experience can vary depending upon how close \
to perfect Goodness, perfect Evil, or pure Neutrality you are.  In addition to receiving no \
experience for violating this rule, you will find your characters alignment slowly changing with \
each repeat offense. \n\r\
\n\r\
For some classes, alignment can have other affects.  Paladins must always be good, and will find \
that their spellcasting ability disappears with their goodness.  Clerics may be good or evil, but \
their spell choices can profoundly impact their alignment.  A Good Cleric or Paladin who casts \
malicious spells will soon find themselves becoming evil.  Evil Clerics can suffer the same fate \
for using benevolent spells.

PETS=Players, especially at lower levels, may wish to purchase or charm animals or \
other creatures to follow them.  These creatures are called pets, and will usually \
assist the player in combat.  This can aid a player who has trouble surviving, though \

Rangers and Druids adventuring with pets are not hindered in this way, however.  The \
number of pets or followers you can have depends on your Charisma score.

Players may purchase and develop property of their own to serve as their online home \
away from home.  \n\r\

that is for sale.  Such properties will typically include a message such as "This lot \
is for sale.".  After finding such a property, the player should enter LOOK ID to \
discover the properties unique lot number identifier.  Write this down!\n\r\
\n\r\
The next step is to find the local Property dealer for that area.  He shouldn't be \
too far away!  Some property dealers deal in player property, and some only deal \
with Clans.  Make sure you find the right one to buy your lot from.  When the \
property dealer is found, you can use your lot number to purchase the correct \
lot from the dealer.\n\r\
\n\r\
Once the property is purchased, you will need to develop it.  Skills such as \
Masonry, Construction, and Locksmithing are used to develop the properties \
you purchase.  If you don't have these skills, or don't want them, you might be \
able to find mobs nearby which you may HIRE to perform these tasks.
