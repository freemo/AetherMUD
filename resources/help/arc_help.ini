Allows you to selectively modify all instances of a mob or item in the world \
based on the contents of a CMARE file containing items or mobs.  These files \
are generated using the EXPORT (WORLD/AREA/ROOM) (ITEMS/WEAPONS) command. \
The first parameter specifies whether the items in the text file are to be \
merged with those in the entire world, in your current area, or just the room. \
The second parameter (CHANGE) is implied to be ALL unless specified otherwise. \
It denotes which fields in the existing items may be changed based on what \
changes are seen to the item inside the CMARE file.   The third parameter \
(ON) is implied to be ALL unless specified otherwise.  It denotes how an item \
in the CMARE file is matched with an existing item in your world.  If the \
listed fields from the CMARE file and the existing item are equal, the items \
will be considered a match for the purposes of merging.  The fourth parameter \
(IGNORE) is implied to be NONE unless specified otherwise.  It denotes \
exceptions to the (ON) parameter, namely which fields are allowed to differ \
between items in the CMARE file and an existing item in cases where they would \
otherwise be considered a match according to the (ON) parameter.  Matched \
items in your existing world, in every room, will be modified accordingly, and \

made to your world.  Every room in every area in your world will be reloaded \

Example : export world data c:\\temp\n\r\
Short(s): \n\r\
The export command will generate the official coffeemud area files, \
whose extension is "*.cmare".  This command may also be used to export \
individual rooms, or unique items or mobs as well.  If the second parameter \
(ITEMS/MOBS/WEAPONS/etc) is NOT specified, export will produce full \
room data for the scope of the first parameter (AREA, ROOM, or WORLD). \
If the second parameter IS specified, then only the specified data will \
be generated.\n\r\
The results will be written to the file given in the last argument, or to the \
screen if "screen" is given as the last argument, or sent to your email address \
if that is enabled.  The extension need not be \
included, as coffeemud will add it if not present.  If a directory name \
is given (no file name), the system will reference the AREA ARCHIVE file \
name for an Area, assuming EXPORT AREA or EXPORT WORLD is used. The default \
directory for this command is the CoffeeMud root.

farther back.\n\r\
\n\r\
STAT will also allow you to retreive basic stat information on a player \
or mob in the game.  Entering STAT and the players name brings up the \
most basic SCORE information.  Including a skill type before the name \
will list their abilities of that type.  Valid skill types include: SKILL, \
