CLASS=Try HELP FIGHTER, THIEF, BARD, CLERIC, MAGE, DRUID, PALADIN, or RANGER.
FIGHTER=\
Fighters are brutish weapon masters, skilled in the art of killing.  They may specialize in any weapon \
type, and learn numerous new fighting techniques as they advance in level.  Fighters receive more hit \
points and attack bonuses per level than any other class, and are invaluable in a close melee.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: The fighters strength is in his domination of pure combat. \
When playing alone, a fighter is fully capable of gaining the necessary \
experience.  However, the fighter may choose to lead a group to gain an \
even greater advantage.  As the tank (primary melee combatant) in a group, \
the fighter will give the group the benefit of his superior armor and fighting \
skill, while benefitting from the healing spells of a cleric, or the magical \
aids of a mage.\
\n\r\n\r\
The fighters greatest weakness is his inability to move secretly, or get into \
or out of tricky spots.  For this reason, the fighter outside of a group \
should steer towards simple combat areas, and be content only with the \
treasures obtains from his kills.\n\r


THIEF=\Thieves are skillful, sly, and devious. They may only use daggers and swords, and may \
only wear leather armor at best.  However, they come with numerous skills allowing them to survive \
in the dog-eat-dog world, including swiping and stealing; hiding, peeking, and sneaking; trapping, \
poisoning, and many others.  Thieves also qualify for many devious fighting abilities.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: The thieves strength is in his ability to obtain money, and in his \
ability to navigate tricky situations.  By accumulating the wealth of others, \
the thief can stay comfortably equipped with the latest and best money can buy. \
When playing alone, the thief thrives as the only class able to get into and \
out of any secret place without stirring up unnecessary trouble.  Although \
not generally appreciated in groups, a group benefits from these skills, as \
well as the thiefs unique ability to deliver enormous amounts of backstab \
damage.\
\n\r\n\r\
The thief is only moderately skilled at combat, but can make up for it by \
using his wealth to obtain favors, good equipment, and the necessary potions \
and scrolls necessary to survive the experience gaining battles.\n\r

DRUID=\Druids are mystical guardians of the natural world, and the wielders of natures grandest \
powers.  They may not wear metal or leather armors, and can only use a small set of natural \
weapons, but their notorious health and magical chants more than make up for this.  Like the \
natural world, Druids are restricted to a neutral alignment.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: The druid is the most complex class to play.  Most of his magic \
requires the assistance of numerous spells to bear fruit, but the benefits make \
the complexity well worth it.  The druid is also best fit for travelling with \
animal armies of his own creation.  In groups, the druid can assist with some \
extra fire power at high levels.  For the most part though, it is alone that \
the druid will flourish, forming his own animal groups to make up for his \
weakness in combat.\
\n\r\n\r\
Although weak in melee combat, due to equipment and skill limitations, the \
druid is capable of marshaling a large troupe of animal aids to assist in \
the vanquishing of foes in order to gain experience.  At high levels, when \
the animals become more of a hindrance than help, the druid finds his magic \
has more than compensated, by providing some of the most powerful and deadly \
of chants.\n\r

BARD=\
Bards are traveling singers, whose "songs" can possess powerful magic.  They are highly desired \
group members for the inspiration they bring to their team members, and the great stings they \
provide to their enemies.  They possess the same weapon and armor restrictions as thieves, but \
also qualify for many thief skills.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: The great strength of the bard is in his wide assortment of \
skills, and in his powerful songs.  The bard may try his hand as the lonesome \
travellor, but will find his skills still put him behind his peers.  It is \
in the company of other, more powerful classes, that the bard will flourish. \
And because of the unique nature of his magic, and how his songs will always \
affect groups, groups will always want to have a bard along.\
\n\r\n\r\
Bards are as weak as thieves in combat, and lack their general sneakiness, \
so in the company of others must the bard find his path to greatness, \
filling any skill gaps in almost any group with the appropriate magic or \
ability.\n\r

CLERIC=\
Clerics are the great vassels of the Gods here on Alra-Paran.  Through them the \
wonders of both good and evil are possible.  Clerics possess great magical abilities in \
their numerous "prayers".  While their weapon choices are limited to their alignment, they \
may wear any type of armor.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: The first, last, and greatest strength of the good Cleric is in \
his ability to heal, just as the ability to harm aids the evil Cleric.  A Cleric \
is unique in his ability to flourish either alone or in groups, being moderately \
skilled in combat, and having the healing ability to last a long time in a \
tough fight.  Clerics are highly desired for groups, however, as the lead \
fighter in the group will want the Cleric's healing touch in battle.\
\n\r\n\r\
The only weakness of the Cleric is offensively, which the evil Cleric will \
make up for with harmful magic, and the good Cleric will compensate for with \
healing spells to last out the battle.  With a balanced approach, the Cleric \
can gain experience with the efficiency of a fighter.\n\r

MAGE=\
Mages are masters of magic, and wielders of the great elemental powers.  While weak in \
hit points and in fighting skill, their spells are the most widely prized and powerful of all \
the classes.  They may not wear any metal or leather armors, or use most weapons.  However, the \
sting of their magic missiles and the armor of magic they wear makes up for any loss.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: Mages are easily the most versatile of classes, being able to make \
spell choices which carve out the path the Mage would like to take.  For the \
loner Mage, the emphasis on offensive magic will make him a powerful opponent in \
battle.  In groups, the mage may focus on protective magic to make him a more \
desirable companion.  And even the playful mage may focus on the role-playing \
magic to make his mudding as fun as possible!\
\n\r\n\r\
The mage is almost useless in weapon combat.  The mage must be smart and \
creative to use his spells to give him the edge.  But the versatility of the \
mage gives him the ability to do just that, using magic and guile to trick \
monsters to their death, granting experience for the mage.\n\r

PALADIN=\
Paladins are holy fighters, possessing many of the traits of both Fighters and Clerics, though \
in less intensity than either class alone.  They may learn Cleric spells at higher levels, and \
possess numerous fighting techniques.  Their weapons and armor choices are unlimited, but \
Paladins are restricted to a good alignment.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: Paladin's have the potential of being the most powerful of classes, \
and the most desired of group members.  Their powerful combat skills and auras \
of power make them the perfect tanks for groups, especially since their Cleric \
healing abilities can allow them to fill this gap in a group.  Alone, they can \
also flourish, vanquishing evil with the efficiency of the fighter.\
\n\r\n\r\
The only weakness of the Paladin is his reliance on goodness.  In most muds, \
this limits his adventuring choices greatly.  However, his strengths for \
lasting and winning in combat are so broad, he will quickly advance.\n\r

RANGER=\
Rangers are noted primarily for their ability to track their friends and enemies, though their \
knowledge of the natural world has also given them great magical strength.  They are a cross \
between the fighter and the druid, gaining druid chants at higher levels, and numerous fighting \
techniques.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: Rangers can provide a unique opportunity for experience advancement \
in a mud.  Their combat skills make them desirable as group members as tanks. \
Their ability to use scrolls gives them access to magic that grants them some \
of the mages versatility.  Meanwhile, the druidic chants they learn can add \
yet another layer of complexity to their advancement decisions.  Like the fighter, \
they may navigate their universe alone or with others, and will flourish either \
way.\
\n\r\n\r\
The Ranger, like the Paladin, is not quite as strong a fighter as a pure \
fighter, but makes up for this using magic.  However, the rangers magic is \
complex and ellusive, becoming only truely powerful at high levels.  In the \
meantime, the ranger must use scrolls and other magical items to supplement \
his natural fighting skill.\n\r

GOOD=ALIGNMENT
EVIL=ALIGNMENT
NEUTRAL=ALIGNMENT
ALIGNMENT=\
Your alignment represents your moral fiber, with Good representing selfless benevolence, \
Evil representing selfish maliciousness, and Neutral representing the balance of the two. \
\n\r\n\r\
In combat, the amount of experience you receive from the vanquishing of a foe depends partially \
on your alignment versus that of the creature you have killed.  In general, if you are Good and \
you kill a Good creature, or Evil and kill an Evil creature, or Neutral and kill a Neutral \
creature, you receive NO experience.  The amount of experience can vary depending upon how close \
to perfect Goodness, perfect Evil, or pure Neutrality you are.  In addition to receiving no \
experience for violating this rule, you will find your characters alignment slowly changing with \
each repeat offense. \n\r\
\n\r\
For some classes, alignment can have other affects.  Paladins must always be good, and will find \
that their spellcasting ability disappears with their goodness.  Clerics may be good or evil, but \
their spell choices can profoundly impact their alignment.  A Good Cleric or Paladin who casts \
malicious spells will soon find themselves becoming evil.  Evil Clerics can suffer the same fate \
for using benevolent spells.
