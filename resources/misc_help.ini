STRENGTH=\
Physical strength and fighting prowess is reflected in strength.  The limit is 18 for all \
classes except Fighter, Paladin, and Ranger.

DEXTERITY=\
Agility and the ability to dodge blows is reflected in Dexterity.  The limit is 18 for all classes \
except Thieves and Rangers.

CONSTITUTION=\
Health, stamina, and the ability to live through harder fights is reflected in Constitution. \
The limit is 18.

INTELLIGENCE=\
Memory and concentration, and the ability to gain greater profficiency in skills and spells through \
practice are reflected in Intelligence.  The limit is 18 for all classes except Mages.

WISDOM=\
Intuition, wit, and the ability to gain more practice points per level is reflected in Wisdom. \
The limit is 18 for all classes except Clerics and Paladins.

CHARISMA=\
Grace, charm, and the ability to get better prices from merchants is reflected in Charisma. \
The limit is 18 for all classes except Bards.

CLASS=Try HELP FIGHTER, THIEF, BARD, CLERIC, MAGE, PALADIN, or RANGER.
FIGHTER=\
Fighters are brutish weapon masters, skilled in the art of killing.  They may specialize in any weapon \
type, and learn numerous new fighting techniques as they advance in level.  Fighters receive more hit \
points and attack bonuses per level than any other class, and are invaluable in a close melee.

THIEF=\Thieves are skillful, sly, and devious. They may only use daggers and swords, and may \
only wear leather armor at best.  However, they come with numerous skills allowing them to survive \
in the dog-eat-dog world, including swiping and stealing; hiding, peeking, and sneaking; trapping, \
poisoning, and many others.  Thieves also qualify for many devious fighting abilities.

BARD=\
Bards are traveling singers, whose "songs" can possess powerful magic.  They are highly desired \
group members for the inspiration they bring to their team members, and the great stings they \
provide to their enemies.  They possess the same weapon and armor restrictions as thieves, but \
also qualify for many thief skills.

CLERIC=\
Clerics are the great vassels of the Gods here on Alra-Paran.  Through them the \
wonders of both good and evil are possible.  Clerics possess great magical abilities in \
their numerous "prayers".  While their weapon choices are limited to their alignment, they \
may wear any type of armor.

MAGE=\
Mages are masters of magic, and wielders of the great elemental powers.  While weak in \
hit points and in fighting skill, their spells are the most widely prized and powerful of all \
the classes.  They may not wear any metal or leather armors, or use most weapons.  However, the \
sting of their magic missiles and the armor of magic they wear makes up for any loss.

PALADIN=\
Paladins are holy fighters, possessing many of the traits of both Fighters and Clerics, though \
in less intensity than either class alone.  They may learn Cleric spells at higher levels, and \
possess numerous fighting techniques.  Their weapons and armor choices are unlimited, but \
Paladins are restricted to a good alignment.

RANGER=\
Rangers are noted primarily for their ability to track their friends and enemies, though their \
knowledge of the natural world has also given them great magical strength.  They are a cross \
between the fighter and the mage, gaining mage spells at higher levels, and numerous fighting \
techniques.

GOOD=ALIGNMENT
EVIL=ALIGNMENT
NEUTRAL=ALIGNMENT
ALIGNMENT=\
Your alignment represents your moral fiber, with Good representing selfless benevolence, \
Evil representing selfish maliciousness, and Neutral representing the balance of the two. \n\r\
\n\r\
In combat, the amount of experience you receive from the vanquishing of a foe depends partially \
on your alignment versus that of the creature you have killed.  In general, if you are Good and \
you kill a Good creature, or Evil and kill an Evil creature, or Neutral and kill a Neutral \
creature, you receive NO experience.  The amount of experience can vary depending upon how close \
to perfect Goodness, perfect Evil, or pure Neutrality you are.  In addition to receiving no \
experience for violating this rule, you will find your characters alignment slowly changing with \
each repeat offense. \n\r\
\n\r\
For some classes, alignment can have other affects.  Paladins must always be good, and will find \
that their spellcasting ability disappears with their goodness.  Clerics may be good or evil, but \
their spell choices can profoundly impact their alignment.  A Good Cleric or Paladin who casts \
malicious spells will soon find themselves becoming evil.  Evil Clerics can suffer the same fate \
for using benevolent spells.

RACE=Try HELP DWARF, ELF, GNOME, HALFELF, HALFLING, or HUMAN.
DWARF=\
Dwarves are shorter than humans, but much stockier, and enjoy sporting beards (including the \
women).  They receive one bonus Constitution point, but lose one Charisma point.  They also \
have Infravision, or the ability to see other creatures in the dark.  Dwarves may be Clerics, \
Fighters, or Thieves.

ELF=\
Elves are slightly shorter and more slender than humans, but are quick and agile.  They \
receive one bonus Dexterity point, but lose one Constitution point. Elves have Infravision, \
and may be Clerics, Fighters, Rangers, Mages, or Thieves.

GNOME=\
Gnomes are curious and quick-witted folk, resembling small dwarves.  They receive one bonus \
Intelligence point, but lose one Wisdom point due to their carelessness.  They also have \
Infravision, and may be Clerics, Fighters, or Thieves.

HALFELF=\
Half Elves are a mixture of humans and elves.  They have Infravision, and may be Bards, \
Clerics, Fighters, Mages, Rangers, and Thieves.

HALFLING=\
Halflings are a very short fur-footed folk.  They receive one bonus Dexterity \
point, but lose one point of Strength.  They have Infravision, and may be Clerics, Fighters, \
or Thieves.

HUMAN=\
Just like you and me!  They receive 2 bonus training points at first level, and may be Bards, \
Clerics, Fighters, Mages, Paladins, Rangers, and Thieves.
