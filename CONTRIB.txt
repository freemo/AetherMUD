Bo would like to acknowledge and thank the following people for contributing, 
both directly and indirectly to the development of CoffeeMud.

Tim Kassebaum, for putting in lord knows how many hours doing head and 
documentation work for versions 3.0-4.0, including just about every spell, 
prayer, subclasses, and 0-level skill, for uncountable ideas (and for 
documenting those too), and for SOMEHOW finding time to playtest amidst
all this.  And of course Hojo, playtesting, bugfinding FOOL!

Jef Kamenek and David Walters, for single handedly adding the ANSI support, 
Archon Help, some very important changes to the base MUD class, writing 
all of the web-server base and for some very appreciated help in debugging.

Thomas Neumann for the fakedb package, and debugging assistance.

George Reese for kindly providing his I3 java implementation.

Jeremy Vyska for Clan support, numerous Enhancements, and debugging support.

Sky for the Moving Behavior.

Lee H. Fox - for numerous coded weapon, armor, and MOB objects and for providing
the base code for the Drow behavior.  Lee also wrote some of the Mage spells, including
"Grace of the Cat", "Giant Strength" and many others.

Michael Rundell - for a few of the coded weapon, armor, and MOB objects, including 
the coded Dragon object, and for providing the base code for the Dragonbreath ability
and the MOBEater behavior.

Tyra and Lori - for single handedly inspiring this project.  I have never ever forgotten that
fact, nor the unusual circumstances surrounding it.  I hope in time they have forgiven me. :)
