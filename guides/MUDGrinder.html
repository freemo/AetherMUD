<p>The MUDGrinder is a visual editing and administration tool. &nbsp; It
includes all of the following:<br>
</p>
<p><b>Control Panel</b>, for changing many of the flexible settings of the
engine.<br>
<b>File Browser</b> lets you browse, delete, upload, or modify text files
in your coffeemud package.<br>
<b>Journals Browser </b>lets you post, read, delete, or reply to any of the
journals (message boards) in your system.<br>
<b>Players List</b> is the place for reviewing your players, their details,
and to quickly BAN THEM!<br>
<b>Manage Resources</b> is an obscure tool for flushing from memory those
things that have been loaded from disk.<br>
<b>Quest Manager</b> allows you to create, destroy, start, stop, and update
Quests and quest scripts.<br>
 <b>Banned List</b> is the place for adding and removing banned names and
ip addresses.<br>
<b>System Reports</b> gives you a quick health and status check for your
mud.<br>
<b>Thread Groups</b> is where you can browse all the different game area
object threads that are running.<br>
<b>Server Log</b> shows you the mud.log file, which is your main log file.<br>
<b>Statistics </b>is where you can browse the gameplay statistics after you've
been running for awhile.<br>
</p>
<p>Also included is a  pleasant&nbsp;alternative to the command-line interface
described in the  <a href="ArchonGuide.html">Archon's Guide</a> for creating
and maintaining the areas, maps,  rooms, monsters, and items inside your
MUD.&nbsp; Instead of typing in commands,  you can point and click to design
your maps.&nbsp; Instead of running around  with your Archon to get an idea
of how things look, you can just point your eyes  at the map on the screen.<br>

<p>                                 The MUDGrinder is a built in part of
the Administrative Web  Site of the CoffeeMud HTTP Web Server.&nbsp; For
more information on this aspect  of CoffeeMud, please refer to the <a
 href="WebServer.html">Web Server Guide</a>.&nbsp; So, if  you have successfully
installed and started up your CoffeeMud Server, and  the Administrative Web
Server has been successfully started as well, then  MUDGrinder is already
installed!&nbsp; Good job!</p>
 
<p>To access MUDGrinder, simply connect to your  Administrative Web Site
(<a href="http://localhost:27777/">http://localhost:27777/</a>)  and log
into the MUDGrinder pages using your Archon administrative account  information.&nbsp;
If you have no idea what an Archon Administrative account is,  you'll need
to start back over again and read the <a href="InstallationGuide.html">Installation
Guide</a>.</p>
 
<p><font color="#ff6666"><strong><font size="5">Not Your Mothers MUDGrinder:</font></strong></font></p>
 
<p>The MUDGrinder is easy to use, but it is not forgiving, and it is not
for  wussies.&nbsp; If you make a mistake, you will probably pay for it.&nbsp;
If you  click the wrong button, you will regret it.&nbsp; Be careful kiddies!</p>
 
<p><font size="5" color="#ffcc99"><strong>Using MUDGrinder:</strong></font></p>
 
<p><font>If you've actually played this game before, and you've read the
<a href="ArchonGuide.html">Archon's  Guide</a>, and you understand it, you
will have  no troubles at all.&nbsp; The MUDGrinder is merely a visual means
of accomplishing the  same tasks, with the same objects and parameters as
are described in the Archon's  Guide.</font></p>
 
<p><font>If you have any further questions, or want to know how to undo a
 mistake, &nbsp;refer to the previous section.</font></p>
 
<p><font color="#ffff66"><strong><font size="5">Author's Notes:</font></strong></font></p>
 
<p>Users of previous versions of the MUDGrinder know that the documentation
 provided for this version of the editor are twice as good as anything provided
 previously.&nbsp; However, the same caveats still apply: do not email Bo
and  tell him that his Java and MUD puns are not funny.&nbsp; He knows they
are  funny.&nbsp; He also knows you think they are funny and that any protests
to the  contrary are vicious lies.</p>
