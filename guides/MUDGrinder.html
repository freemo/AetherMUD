      <h2><a name="what">What Is the MUDGrinder:</a></h2>


      
      <p>
        The MUDGrinder is a visual editing and administration tool. It
        includes all of the following:
      </p>


      
      <ul>

        <li>
          <p><b>Control Panel</b>, for changing many of the flexible settings of the engine.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>File Browser</b> lets you browse, delete, upload, or modify text files in your CoffeeMud package.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>Journals Browser</b> lets you post, read, delete, or reply to any of the journals (message boards) in your system.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>Players List</b> is the place for reviewing your players and the banned names/ips list.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>Cache Resources</b> is an obscure tool for flushing from memory those things that have been loaded from disk.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>Quests Manager</b> allows you to create, destroy, start, stop, and update Quests and quest scripts.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>System Reports</b> gives you a quick health and status check for your mud. &nbsp;Also includes a Threads report.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Server Log</b> shows you the mud.log file, which is your main log file.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>Statistics</b> is where you can browse the gameplay statistics after you've been running for awhile.</p>
        </li>

      
      </ul>


      
      <p>
       Also included is a pleasant alternative to the command-line
       interface described in the <a href="ArchonGuide.html">Archon's
       Guide</a> for creating and maintaining the areas, maps, rooms,
       monsters, and items inside your MUD. Instead of typing in
       commands, you can point and click to design your maps. Instead of
       running around with your Archon to get an idea of how things look, you
       can just point your eyes at the map on the screen.
      </p>


      
      <h2><a name="install">Installation:</a></h2>


      
      <p>
       The MUDGrinder is a built in part of the Administrative Web Site of the
       CoffeeMud HTTP Web Server. For more information on this aspect of
       CoffeeMud, please refer to the <a href="WebServer.html">Web Server
       Guide</a>. So, if you have successfully installed and started up
       your CoffeeMud Server, and the Administrative Web Server has been
       successfully started as well, then MUDGrinder is already
       installed! Good job!
      </p>


      
      <p>
       To access MUDGrinder, simply connect to your Administrative Web Site
       (<a href="http://localhost:27777/">http://localhost:27777/</a>) and log
       into the MUDGrinder pages using your Archon administrative account
       information. If you have no idea what an Archon Administrative
       account is, you'll need to start back over again and read the <a href="InstallationGuide.html">Installation Guide</a>.
      </p>


      
      <h2><a name="mother">Not Your Mothers MUDGrinder:</a></h2>


      
      <p>
       The MUDGrinder is easy to use, but it is not forgiving, and it is not
       for wussies. If you make a mistake, you will probably pay for
       it. If you click the wrong button, you will regret it. Be
       careful kiddies!
      </p>


      
      <h2><a name="use">Using MUDGrinder:</a></h2>


      
      <p>
       If you've actually played this game before, and you've read the
       <a href="ArchonGuide.html">Archon's Guide</a>, and you understand it,
       you will have no troubles at all. The MUDGrinder is merely a
       visual means of accomplishing the same tasks, with the same objects and
       parameters as are described in the Archon's Guide.
      </p>


      
      <p>
       If you have any further questions, or want to know how to undo a
       mistake, refer to the previous section.
      </p>


      
      <h2><a name="notes">Author's Notes:</a></h2>


      
      <p>
       Users of previous versions of the MUDGrinder know that the
       documentation provided for this version of the editor are twice as good
       as anything provided previously. However, the same caveats still
       apply: do not email Bo and tell him that his Java and MUD puns are not
       funny. He knows they are funny. He also knows you think
       they are funny and that any protests to the contrary are vicious lies.
