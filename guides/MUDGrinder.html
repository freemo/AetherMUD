<P><STRONG><FONT size=5>What Is the MUDGrinder:</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>The MUDGrinder is a visual editing tool.&nbsp; It is a 
pleasant&nbsp;alternative to the command-line interface described in the 
Archon's Guide (ArchonGuide.html) for creating and maintaining the areas, maps, 
rooms, monsters, and items inside your MUD.&nbsp; Instead of typing in commands, 
you can point and click to design your maps.&nbsp; Instead of running around 
with your Archon to get an idea of how things look, you can just point your eyes 
at the map on the screen.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=5>Installation:</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>In previous versions of the CoffeeMud Server, the 
MUDGrinder referred to a stand-alone Java Swing application.&nbsp; This 
application, when run, would connect directly to your CoffeeMud server and 
thereby read and write your areas.&nbsp; In CoffeeMud 3.0, the MUDGrinder is a 
built in part of the Administrative Web Site of the CoffeeMud HTTP Web 
Server.&nbsp; For more information on this aspect of CoffeeMud, please refer to 
the Web Server Guide (WebServer.html).&nbsp; It should be noted that previous 
versions of the MUDGrinder will not work with CoffeeMud 3.0.&nbsp; You 
might even damage something trying.&nbsp; Don't.&nbsp;</P>
<P>So, if you have successfully installed and started up your CoffeeMud Server, 
and the Administrative Web Server has been successfully started as well, then 
MUDGrinder is already installed!&nbsp; Good job!</P>
<P>To access MUDGrinder, simply connect to your Administrative Web Site (<A 
href="http://localhost:27777/index.html">http://localhost:27777/index.html</A>) 
and log into the MUDGrinder pages using your Archon administrative account 
information.&nbsp; If you have no idea what an Archon Administrative account is, 
you'll need to start back over again and read the Installation Guide 
(InstallationGuide.html).</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=5>Not Your Mothers MUDGrinder:</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>The MUDGrinder is easy to use, but it is not forgiving, and it is not for 
wussies.&nbsp; If you make a mistake, you will probably pay for it.&nbsp; If you 
click the wrong button, you will regret it.&nbsp; Be careful kiddies!</P>
<P><FONT size=5><STRONG>Using MUDGrinder:</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT>If you've read the Archon's 
Guide (ArchonGuide.html), and you understand it, you will have 
no troubles at all.&nbsp; The MUDGrinder is merely a visual means of accomplishing the 
same tasks, with the same objects and parameters as are described in the Archon's 
Guide.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT>If you have any further questions, or want to know how to undo a 
mistake, &nbsp;refer to the previous section.</FONT></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=5>Author's Notes:</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>Users of previous versions of the MUDGrinder know that the documentation 
provided for this version of the editor are twice as good as anything provided 
previously.&nbsp; However, the same caveats still apply: do not email Bo and 
tell him that his Java and MUD puns are not funny.&nbsp; He knows they are 
funny.&nbsp; He also knows you think they are funny and that any protests to the 
contrary are vicious lies.</P>
