! Add Area objects and Tables and Affect/Properties!
! Allow classes and directories to be assigned in the INI file in addition to the default path.
! Create a custom command ability, include ability to override existing commands!
! Add Notes abilities -- really need for bug fix reporting!  Done this way: a Journal can be read, it will list the posts for a given Journal.  
! hit and miss strings in the Weapon.  Natural Weapons can also be retreived from MOBs, or from Races by default.
! From Maree: (Game/Heath Texts), the descriptions for the health of a MOB should be moved to a text file (A resource?), that is loaded.  The descriptions would be assigned to the MOB at build time, and should be assignable to GENMOBS via a new tag.
! ranged combat?! Yes! And thrown weapons! And ranged pole-arms!
! Add CoffeeMud area files! can import and export rooms or areas
! Languages!  Affects says and replies if you don't know a language spoken by the speaker.
! Make mountable MOBS, and mountable Items. Mounted animals will take half of all combat damage, will add to attack ability, and increase movement and will act as a container for the purposes of cargo.  Mounted Items will not appear in inventory, and be restrained to a terrain type (air, water, etc).  More than one person can mount an item (a boat).  
! Armor damage/repair, especially cloth from fire, and metal armor from bludgeoning/leather armor from slashing.  
! banks! (Well, the moneychanger behavior is good enough).
! exp from sac/des also based on level of the body.  Set body levels based on char level.
! Serve and Rebuke commands.  Any character may take on a leige. A Leige receives 10% of all experience gained by the vassels, providing incentive to assist the vassel.
! Weapon condition, sharpness, and bluntness Weapon repair and sharpening/blunting.

Crawl command, is_crawling, and crawling requirements for exits

Convert some properties to work with the new areas. Prop_NOMOB, etc..

0-level abilities.  Trade skills to produce mundane items.  One would go to a "factory", where  one could buy raw materials.  Facilities available there would be used, along with your skill, to  produce a finished product..e.g. a shirt, pants, minor weapons and armor, etc.  Mining, Fishing,  Woodcutting, etc.. to get raw materials.  Cooking to improve the nourishment of Food objects (and  remove rawness from Meat).  The LeatherWorker ability can mend leather items, Tailor cloth items, etc..

Furniture.. chairs to sit in, beds to lie in, tables to put things on?

Multi-Room Item Transporter.  Have a TeleportingContainer that, whenever anything is inside it, it 
will send the items to the appropriate GateObject.  The GateObject can be either a container or not. 
If not, the GateObject will drop its cargo on the floor.  The TeleportingContainer and the GateObject 
will have identical MiscText fields to establish the Keys between them.

A Multi-Room Gate would work the same way.  An Entry, Exit, and TwoWay type would be constructed.  The 
Entry type would accept "ENTER" commands from MOBs, and drag all followers along, of course.  The 
Following thing would be automatic, if an Exit and Direction extensions are used.

Add last-call date/time string to the "list users" command

be able to drink or fill waterskin from freshwater locales

HuntableAnimals that produce pieces of raw meat in inventory when killed.  Poisoned and poisoning 
animals will produce poisoned meat, of course.

For trade skills, and to make spells more realistic, perfect the delay of these abilities, and
allow some message to be displayed as they are put in Que.  For example "You start whittling" (delay)
"You have completed your piece of art". (Combat should cancel this!)

Meditation for Mage should be like Endurance for Fighter.

Predict Weather spell! Change weather! Call Lightening! Call hailstones!

Lore skill for Bards.. allows an identify for them.

More stuff for Fighters, especially Paladins and Rangers, who must use their 
trains for spells.  Perhaps fill in Paladin and Ranger gaps with spells!  Sweep would make a good Fighter ability, as would cleave!

iron grip spell to thwart disarm

Buy command for standard mobs, to facilitate trades.

Guilds will have the ability to take on a character and make him or her the class sponsored by the 
guild.  These will be special Sub-Classes (derivatives of existing classes).  SubClasses: 
Wild Mage: 50% chance similar (diff) spell is cast (higher level, perhaps)

derivatives of the standard Interfaces.
