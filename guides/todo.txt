Nonconvertable—MOB won’t accept another religion.
IMPROVED TURNING:  Affects your bonus to Turn or control.  Don’t give this to anyone yet, but specialty clerics will need to have access to it.
* ENHANCEMENT, Where the * stands for a school of magic.  Makes spells of this nature upto twice as effective (doubling damage dealt, effect, ect.)
* EXTENSION, Where * is a school of magic, makes all spells cast from that school last up to twice as long.
* RESISTANCE, Where * is a school of magic, adds resistance to all harmful spells from that school.
* SPECIALIZATION, Where * is a school of magic, makes all spells from that school more difficult to resist.
CONVERT:  A Cleric may convert a character to his Diety.  It will ask a confirmation from the other character.  Cleric gains 25 XP for each conversion.  A Cleric MAY attempt to convert MOBs, and get that XP.  A Cleric loses 25 XP for killing a MOB of his religion.

Sermon:  (Bard/Cleric) takes a lot of time and mana to cast, then acts like a mass follow for a short time.  (The MOBs, if they haven’t been provoked, will follow the cleric/bard for a short while.  After that while, they will RECALL to their starting location (or just destroy and refresh?))

Guilds will have the ability to take on a character and make him or her the class sponsored by the 
guild.  These will be special Sub-Classes (derivatives of existing classes).  SubClasses: 
Wild Mage: 50% chance similar (diff) spell is cast (higher level, perhaps)
Assassin: Assassinate skill to auto-kill, lose something else though
Priests of specific Gods: bonuses to like spells, lose others
Prancers: Dancing bards who get special ability
Illusionist: Illusion spells at 100%, get all of them
Alchemist: brew spells into potions, missile potions, transmute stuff to gold, cloth to metal, etc..
Wizard: must memorize spells from book.  Profficiency check at casting time (unerring in casting).  No memorizing duplicates.  Mana is consumed at memorize time.
trashcan behavior that can be added to items to destroy unwanted items.
ARTISAN:  Master of all the common skills.  Gets a bonus of 5 EXTRA RANDOM common skills at 1st level.  GAINS a common skill every level. (We would want to distribute them out over the 1st 10 levels).  It is possible that the ARTISAN will GAIN a skill that he already took.  Could be a problem writing that code.  ARTISANS have a special ability to DECORATE.  This would allow any item that they want to become a permenant item in that room.  The item has a REJUV rate of 999999 or something silly like that, so it will be rejuved anytime you do a reboot, but at almost no other time.  They would also need the TRADE command, allowing players a safe trade of items.  TRADE HELM 1000.  <to other player> DO YOU AGREE TO GIVE 1000 FOR THE BLACK HELM (y/N)?  The ARTISAN would have prime attributes of WIS and CHA. (They need to be charming to sell their goods, they really need the WIS to get the practices.)  ARTISANS would have a few combat abilities (because they may need to hunt, forage, mine and chop through a few monsters to get their goods.)  Basically looking like a bard for combat abilities.  Heck, give them a couple of BARDIC SONGS to qualify for (just city based ones, though.)  ARTISANS should be able to get the SCROLL, CLARIFY SCROLL, ENCHANT ARMOR, and ENCHANT WEAPON spells at equal level or lower to a MAGE.  I would love it if they could get CURE LIGHT WOUNDS without being able to pray (so that they could put it in a potion or on a scroll) as well as a few other simple prayers and spells.
Mage subclasses:
Each level:  GAIN all spells from specialty school.  Qualifies for all non-opposed spells.  Does not qualify for opposed spells (unless this is too hard to code.)
Level 0:  -20% saves vs opposed school. +1%/lvl save vs specialty school. 100% failure to cast opposed school spells.
Level 1: -1%/lvl to opponents saves on Specialty spells.
Level 5: +2%/lvl to damage from specialty school. (This gives reason to STAY in school.  You lose this modifier if your class is a different specialty.)
Level 10: *2 duration on specialty spells
Level 15:  New spell:  Weakness to (Specialty).  Only specialists may learn this spell, and it reduces the target's resistance by 50% to spells from that specialty.
Level 30:  (Specialty) Mastery.  Spells cast by a master have an additional -30% save.  (On top of the level 1 modifier.)
Illusion opposes Divination    (Lies vs Truth)
Evocation opposes Alteration (Creating something out of nothing, vs modifying that which exists.)
Abjuration opposes Enchantment (Protection vs Control)
Conjuration opposes Transmutation (Summoning a creature vs changing an existing creature)

1)	Waypoints—A Land Based auto-travelling system.  Any area that has a Prop_WayPoint can be accessed from another Prop_WayPoint Area, provided the character has the TRAVELLER skill, and has learned each of those way points.  The computer will determine (approx) the shortest route from WayPoint A to WayPoint B.  If the path becomes blocked or someone attacks the TRAVELLER, then the traveling stops in that room.  Note: You can only initiate the TRAVELLER skill from a WayPoint.
2)	Seapoints—A sea based auto-travelling system.
