//****** next version ********************************************************
GenRaces
GenCharClasses
racial abilities (abilities tied to the race)
Some solution for variable eq on mobs
Item Interactivity (Scriptable + socials that require an ITEM target) Tapping your broadsword.  Poking some strange item you found on the critter you just killed.  Licking, sniffing, tasting food.  
SMTP capability
Make size important for weapons.  Characters can hold items of (Char Size/2) in one hand, and (2*Char size) in 2 hands.
Arrest idea: banned substances (get, drop, eq, etc), and harder sentence for parole.
apply languages to writing as well. Should be simple, right? ha!
Room descriptions varying by the time of day.
Weather affecting movement, flooding, slipping, vision.  Behaviors for floods and fires.
Conquest Area behavior
Scalp - Barbarian(5), Templar(10), Assassin (10), or Thief(20)
DEPRESSION.  -10 to Attack, Gets hungry faster (10% or so), reduced saves vs Justice (-20%), Reduced chance of pregnancy/fertility.  People who get depressed generally have less enthusiasm about everything (fighting, sex, personal property...it's all pointless anyways) and tend to eat more.  (Thereby getting FAT.)
YAWNS.  if you get too fatigued, you may get this disease, which is contagious.  No effect other than the occassionally yawning.
Obessity.  It doesn't change your WEIGHT, per se.  It creates a unseeable undroppable item of FAT for the duration of the obessity.  You can get rid of Obessity with a cure disease, or by remaining hungry for a good while.  You contract obessity by overeatting.
Alcoholism.  If you drink too much alcohol, you risk gaining this disease.  If you don't drink a glass of alcohol every 3 MUD hours, then you get a -10 to attack and defense.  This penalty is cummulative until you drink alcohol, or you go 5 MUD days without alcohol.  Staying logged off for 5 MUD isn't suffecient....I hope.
WIZINFO type channel (shows logins, logoffs, creates, etc..)
jewelmaking should allow you to add jewels to any item
smokable stuff, mouth position pipes, smokable resources, etc.
parse out all the commands into classes, so that access can be class based, and time req can be determined
could you expand the languages to include GOBLIN, GIANT, TERRAN (earth), AQUAN (water), IGNAN(fire), and AURIAL(air), and SYLVAN (woodland)? How much work is this?
BOOKS! paper with multiple pages to post on. Add to the papermaking skill. Also add Poster, Banner, and Screen.
TaxCollector Area Behavior. Designated mob wanders an area and charges taxesbased on the last time that you have paid taxes.

Space ships/sailing ships as Locale types
Ship Dealer shopkeepers that use Space Ship templates as basis.
Create Outer Space.
Create Docking areas.
Electronic items which can be activated/deactivated, grant some affect, and use up power
Prop_TechShield that absorbs enormous damage, but like Prop_SpellReflector -- needs reset time.

Wild Mage: 50% of the time, a spell cast will end up higher level, different spell.
level and type and wear locations for weaponsmithing and armorsmithing
possible to have NE SE SW NW directions?  Yes, but StdMap and MUDGrinder would get hit hard...
LYING DOWN position?
Z-level for the GrinderMap (elevation?) how the heck would THAT work...
group formations as an alternative way of determining range
