Add Area objects and Tables and Affect/Properties!

Allow classes and directories to be assigned in the INI file in addition to the default path.

From Maree: (Game/Heath Texts), the descriptions for the health of a MOB should be moved to a text file
(A resource?), that is loaded.  The descriptions would be assigned to the MOB at build time, and
should be assignable to GENMOBS via a new tag.

More WeaponTypes, with text file (Resource)? descriptions.  These should also be
assignable to MOBs at build time, or to GENMOBs via a new tag.

Add CoffeeMud area files!

Buy command for standard mobs, to facilitate trades.

0-level abilities.  Trade skills to produce mundane items.  One would go to a "factory", where 
one could buy raw materials.  Facilities available there would be used, along with your skill, to 
produce a finished product..e.g. a shirt, pants, minor weapons and armor, etc.  Mining, Fishing, 
Woodcutting, etc.. to get raw materials.  Cooking to improve the nourishment of Food objects (and 
remove rawness from Meat).

ThievesTools required for picking locks, check/remove traps without severe penalty.

HuntableAnimals that produce pieces of raw meat in inventory when killed.  Poisoned and poisoning 
animals will produce poisoned meat, of course.

Beacon, Worship command to change recall/start room to a new temple or church.  Worshiped room would 
also get ticked, and previews of actions,  which will improve the Cleric class considerably.  

Meditation for Mage should be like Endurance for Fighter.
Lore skill for Bards.. allows an identify for them.

Guilds will have the ability to take on a character and make him or her the class sponsored by the 
guild.  These will be special Sub-Classes (derivatives of existing classes).

Serve and Rebuke commands.  Any character may take on a leige, but Clerics may only take worshipper
of the same god (room) as a leige.  A Leige receives 10% of all experience gained by the
vassels, providing incentive to assist the vassel.

Seperate commands to objects, like abilities.  This will provide the easy addition of custom commands.

To make mouted riding possible, allow Environmentals to modify displayText.  Mounted animals
will take half of all combat damage, will add to attack ability, and increase movement and will
act as a container for the purposes of cargo.

For trade skills, and to make spells more realistic, perfect the delay of these abilities, and
allow some message to be displayed as they are put in Que.  For example "You start whittling" (delay)
"You have completed your piece of art". (Combat should cancel this!)

iron grip spell to thwart disarm

Multi-Room Item Transporter.  Have a TeleportingContainer that, whenever anything is inside it, it 
will send the items to the appropriate GateObject.  The GateObject can be either a container or not. 
If not, the GateObject will drop its cargo on the floor.  The TeleportingContainer and the GateObject 
will have identical MiscText fields to establish the Keys between them.

A Multi-Room Gate would work the same way.  An Entry, Exit, and TwoWay type would be constructed.  The 
Entry type would accept "ENTER" commands from MOBs, and drag all followers along, of course.  The 
Following thing would be automatic, if an Exit and Direction extensions are used.

If you are adventurous, put the Archon GenProperties modifiers into a method so that Generic object 
properties can be more easily added without affecting the ONE class.

PlayerKill flag

Modify MUDGrinder,ROOMXML,CONTENTXML to support new Gen standard
