Perhaps a little modification to have the mob act as a better assassin, and the ability to put numbers in front of the direction with doing a GO command.
Mining, Foraging, Etc ought to be able to accept a parameter, so MINE IRON would do mine, but would stop mining if you found something other than IRON, and tell you where you might try looking.

Auto quests, quests, questbox (Behavior)
Ambusher—This gives the MOB an aggressive attitude, with the hide and backstab skills.  Ambushers may have a delay on them, a number of ticks before they come out of hiding and attack.
Thieves attack/damage closer to a fighter, to balance out the bad armor.
ReligiousHelper—Aids other MOBs of given religion
Nonconvertable—MOB won’t accept another religion.
IMPROVED TURNING:  Affects your bonus to Turn or control.  Don’t give this to anyone yet, but specialty clerics will need to have access to it.
* ENHANCEMENT, Where the * stands for a school of magic.  Makes spells of this nature upto twice as effective (doubling damage dealt, effect, ect.)
* EXTENSION, Where * is a school of magic, makes all spells cast from that school last up to twice as long.
* RESISTANCE, Where * is a school of magic, adds resistance to all harmful spells from that school.
* SPECIALIZATION, Where * is a school of magic, makes all spells from that school more difficult to resist.
CONVERT:  A Cleric may convert a character to his Deity.  It will ask a confirmation from the other character.  Cleric gains 25 XP for each conversion.  A Cleric MAY attempt to convert MOBs, and get that XP.  A Cleric loses 25 XP for killing a MOB of his religion.
Sniper.  This allows a character to make a single ranged attack from a hidden position without entering combat.  After the shot, combat is ended, as is the Hide.
Sermon:  (Bard/Cleric) takes a lot of time and mana to cast, then acts like a mass follow for a short time.  (The MOBs, if they haven’t been provoked, will follow the cleric/bard for a short while.  After that while, they will RECALL to their starting location (or just destroy and refresh?))
Offering: A cleric may sacrifice money to their deity.  Doing so restores X/10 Mana points.
Make size important for weapons.  Characters can hold items of (Char Size/2) in one hand, and (2*Char size) in 2 hands.
When Underwater, all slashing and Bludgeoning damage is reduced by a factor of 3, after all other modifiers for damage have been calculated.

'law' area, intelligent MOBs should cry out when they're being attacked, and officers should come to their rescue.
random monster property class which reads stats from a resource file

Guilds will have the ability to take on a character and make him or her the class sponsored by the 
guild.  These will be special Sub-Classes (derivatives of existing classes).  SubClasses: 
Assassin: Assassinate skill to auto-kill, lose something else though
Priests of specific Gods: bonuses to like spells, lose others
Prancers: Dancing bards who get special ability
Alchemist: brew spells into potions, missile potions, transmute stuff to gold, cloth to metal, etc..
Wizard: must memorize spells from book.  Profficiency check at casting time (unerring in casting).  No memorizing duplicates.  Mana is consumed at memorize time.
trashcan behavior that can be added to items to destroy unwanted items.
ARTISAN:  Master of all the common skills.  Gets a bonus of 5 EXTRA RANDOM common skills at 1st level.  GAINS a common skill every level. (We would want to distribute them out over the 1st 10 levels).  It is possible that the ARTISAN will GAIN a skill that he already took.  Could be a problem writing that code.  ARTISANS have a special ability to DECORATE.  This would allow any item that they want to become a permenant item in that room.  The item has a REJUV rate of 999999 or something silly like that, so it will be rejuved anytime you do a reboot, but at almost no other time.  They would also need the TRADE command, allowing players a safe trade of items.  TRADE HELM 1000.  <to other player> DO YOU AGREE TO GIVE 1000 FOR THE BLACK HELM (y/N)?  The ARTISAN would have prime attributes of WIS and CHA. (They need to be charming to sell their goods, they really need the WIS to get the practices.)  ARTISANS would have a few combat abilities (because they may need to hunt, forage, mine and chop through a few monsters to get their goods.)  Basically looking like a bard for combat abilities.  Heck, give them a couple of BARDIC SONGS to qualify for (just city based ones, though.)  ARTISANS should be able to get the SCROLL, CLARIFY SCROLL, ENCHANT ARMOR, and ENCHANT WEAPON spells at equal level or lower to a MAGE.  I would love it if they could get CURE LIGHT WOUNDS without being able to pray (so that they could put it in a potion or on a scroll) as well as a few other simple prayers and spells.

1)	Waypoints—A Land Based auto-travelling system.  Any area that has a Prop_WayPoint can be accessed from another Prop_WayPoint Area, provided the character has the TRAVELLER skill, and has learned each of those way points.  The computer will determine (approx) the shortest route from WayPoint A to WayPoint B.  If the path becomes blocked or someone attacks the TRAVELLER, then the traveling stops in that room.  Note: You can only initiate the TRAVELLER skill from a WayPoint.
2)	Seapoints—A sea based auto-travelling system.
add Bridge to Construct and Mason, that allows a bridge over a watery surface. Must take a LOT of material, though. On the order of 4000.
