Bard Subclasses
Programming.html update
Work on memory-usage relief
Prayer could be a SunCURSE.  If the MOB enters a sunlit room, it turns to stone (petrification).  
Sermon:  (Bard/Cleric) takes a lot of time and mana to cast, then acts like a mass follow for a short time.  (The MOBs, if they haven’t been provoked, will follow the cleric/bard for a short while.  After that while, they will RECALL to their starting location (or just destroy and refresh?))
Druids should have some chants that affect Sex: Mating Instinct, a geas to find a creature of same race/opposite gender. Find Mate , a chant to track someone of opposite sex (closest?) that can be cast on others (CHANT find mate zara) will make zara be able to find a mate of (elf male) type. Feel Sex makes sexual activities more intense, basically just giving WONDERFUL sex results. YEARN SEX is a chant that makes the target suffer 8 WIS until they have sex (or the chant wears off). CROSSGENDER is a chant that maker any gender valid for sex. HOMOSEXUALITY, duh. NEUTER is a chant that makes no gender sexually viable. SPEED BIRTH creates a lvl 1 MOB of that Race, after sex. FERTILITY makes a BIRTH produce more offspring.
Spell: 'Rogue Limb'  One sof your limbs goes out of your control, causing you to do battle with it.  However, you take both sides of the damage.  heh.
ignore list, for ignoreing players/gossips/who/etc.. 
friends list, for filter who (who works ok, but who friends shows just friends)
ReScore button for items, to get default att/armor from level.

//****** next version ********************************************************
Arrest idea: banned substances (get, drop, eq, etc), and resisting arrest, and harder sentence for parole.
SMTP capability
Z-level for the GrinderMap (elevation?) how the heck would THAT work...
group formations as an alternative way of determining range
Room descriptions varying by the time of day.
Item Interactivity (Scriptable + socials that require an ITEM target) Tapping your broadsword.  Poking some strange item you found on the critter you just killed.  Licking, sniffing, tasting food.  
Space ships as Locale types
Ship Dealer shopkeepers that use Space Ship templates as basis.
Create Outer Space.
Create Docking areas.
Electronic items which can be activated/deactivated, grant some affect, and use up power
Prop_TechShield that absorbs enormous damage, but like Prop_SpellReflector -- needs reset time.
possible to have NE SE SW NW directions?
racial abilities (abilities tied to the race)
apply languages to writing as well. Should be simple, right?
Conquest Area behavior
GenRaces
GenCharClasses
Some solution for variable eq on mobs
Make size important for weapons.  Characters can hold items of (Char Size/2) in one hand, and (2*Char size) in 2 hands.
ARTISAN:  Master of all the common skills.  Gets a bonus of 5 EXTRA RANDOM common skills at 1st level.  GAINS a common skill every level. (We would want to distribute them out over the 1st 10 levels).  It is possible that the ARTISAN will GAIN a skill that he already took.  Could be a problem writing that code.  ARTISANS have a special ability to DECORATE.  This would allow any item that they want to become a permenant item in that room.  The item has a REJUV rate of 999999 or something silly like that, so it will be rejuved anytime you do a reboot, but at almost no other time.  The ARTISAN would have prime attributes of WIS and CHA. (They need to be charming to sell their goods, they really need the WIS to get the practices.)  ARTISANS would have a few combat abilities (because they may need to hunt, forage, mine and chop through a few monsters to get their goods.)  Basically looking like a bard for combat abilities.  Heck, give them a couple of BARDIC SONGS to qualify for (just city based ones, though.)  ARTISANS should be able to get the SCROLL, CLARIFY SCROLL, ENCHANT ARMOR, and ENCHANT WEAPON spells at equal level or lower to a MAGE.  I would love it if they could get CURE LIGHT WOUNDS without being able to pray (so that they could put it in a potion or on a scroll) as well as a few other simple prayers and spells.
Wild Mage: 50% of the time, a spell cast will end up higher level, different spell.
level and type and wear locations for weaponsmithing and armorsmithing
LYING DOWN position?
