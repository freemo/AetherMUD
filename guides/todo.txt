SMTP capability
Arrest idea: banned substances (get, drop, eq, etc), and harder sentence for parole.
Z-level for the GrinderMap (elevation?) how the heck would THAT work...
group formations as an alternative way of determining range
Room descriptions varying by the time of day.
Item Interactivity (Scriptable + socials that require an ITEM target) Tapping your broadsword.  Poking some strange item you found on the critter you just killed.  Licking, sniffing, tasting food.  
Space ships as Locale types
Ship Dealer shopkeepers that use Space Ship templates as basis.
Create Outer Space.
Create Docking areas.
Electronic items which can be activated/deactivated, grant some affect, and use up power
Prop_TechShield that absorbs enormous damage, but like Prop_SpellReflector -- needs reset time.
possible to have NE SE SW NW directions?  Yes, but StdMap and MUDGrinder would get hit hard...
racial abilities (abilities tied to the race)
apply languages to writing as well. Should be simple, right? ha!
Conquest Area behavior
GenRaces
GenCharClasses
Some solution for variable eq on mobs
Make size important for weapons.  Characters can hold items of (Char Size/2) in one hand, and (2*Char size) in 2 hands.
ARTISAN:  Master of all the common skills.  Bonus 5 EXTRA RANDOM common skills at 1st level.  GAINS a common skill every level. WIS and CHA. Bard combat. BARDIC SONGS to qualify for.
Wild Mage: 50% of the time, a spell cast will end up higher level, different spell.
level and type and wear locations for weaponsmithing and armorsmithing
LYING DOWN position?
