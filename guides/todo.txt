Electronic items which can be activated/deactivated, grant some affect, and use up power
Prop_TechShield that absorbs enormous damage, but like Prop_SpellReflector -- needs reset time.

Sniper.  This allows a character to make a single ranged attack from a hidden position without entering combat.  After the shot, combat is ended, as is the Hide.
Sermon:  (Bard/Cleric) takes a lot of time and mana to cast, then acts like a mass follow for a short time.  (The MOBs, if they haven’t been provoked, will follow the cleric/bard for a short while.  After that while, they will RECALL to their starting location (or just destroy and refresh?))
'law' area, intelligent MOBs should cry out when they're being attacked, and officers should come to their rescue.
Space ships as Locale types
fleas as a disease -- contageous!
Improve maps to divide area into sections
Ship Dealer shopkeepers that use Space Ship templates as basis.
Create Outer Space.

a Behavior you can apply to rooms that sets the resources available in that room type with a param that allows someone to choose to extend or override the resource list.
Spell: 'Rogue Limb'  One sof your limbs goes out of your control, causing you to do battle with it.  However, you take both sides of the damage.  heh.
Etching would be an awesome new skill! To Etch symbols on you gear. Liatshard hold a Platinum Giant Sword with an Eagle Etched on it.
ARTISAN:  Master of all the common skills.  Gets a bonus of 5 EXTRA RANDOM common skills at 1st level.  GAINS a common skill every level. (We would want to distribute them out over the 1st 10 levels).  It is possible that the ARTISAN will GAIN a skill that he already took.  Could be a problem writing that code.  ARTISANS have a special ability to DECORATE.  This would allow any item that they want to become a permenant item in that room.  The item has a REJUV rate of 999999 or something silly like that, so it will be rejuved anytime you do a reboot, but at almost no other time.  They would also need the TRADE command, allowing players a safe trade of items.  TRADE HELM 1000.  <to other player> DO YOU AGREE TO GIVE 1000 FOR THE BLACK HELM (y/N)?  The ARTISAN would have prime attributes of WIS and CHA. (They need to be charming to sell their goods, they really need the WIS to get the practices.)  ARTISANS would have a few combat abilities (because they may need to hunt, forage, mine and chop through a few monsters to get their goods.)  Basically looking like a bard for combat abilities.  Heck, give them a couple of BARDIC SONGS to qualify for (just city based ones, though.)  ARTISANS should be able to get the SCROLL, CLARIFY SCROLL, ENCHANT ARMOR, and ENCHANT WEAPON spells at equal level or lower to a MAGE.  I would love it if they could get CURE LIGHT WOUNDS without being able to pray (so that they could put it in a potion or on a scroll) as well as a few other simple prayers and spells.
Perhaps a little modification to have the mob act as a better assassin, 
Assassin: Assassinate skill to auto-kill, lose something else though
Prancers: Dancing bards who get special ability
a Lizard M Bo, could you direct me to how to review all of the races stats? Lizardmen should be nice and strong, but this guy has a -1 to STR, -6 to INT, and -8 to CHA.
druidic chant HARDEN FLESH gives an armor coating, and avoids affects of weather. WINTER COAT grows a lot of fur, and grants protection against elements as well as some cold resistance.
on your webpage, can you list the classes by prime class, and then available subclasses? The shear number of classes is starting to get a little confusing...(And I have seen them all!)
create a WISH LOG so that every time someone casts a wish, it updates the log with the wish. This way the Archons can see what people are wishing for, and it will help us figure out phrasings of wishes.
when you get SEX created, druids should have some chants that affect it: Mating Instinct , a geas to find a creature of same race/opposite gender. Find Mate , a chant to track someone of opposite sex (closest?) that can be cast on others (CHANT find mate zara) will make zara be able to find a mate of (elf male) type. Feel Sex makes sexual activities more intense, basically just giving WONDERFUL sex results. YEARN SEX is a chant that makes the target suffer 8 WIS until they have sex (or the chant wears off). CROSSGENDER is a chant that maker any gender valid for sex. HOMOSEXUALITY, duh. NEUTER is a chant that makes no gender sexually viable. SPEED BIRTH creates a lvl 1 MOB of that Race, after sex. FERTILITY makes a BIRTH produce more offspring.

1)	Waypoints—A Land Based auto-travelling system.  Any area that has a Prop_WayPoint can be accessed from another Prop_WayPoint Area, provided the character has the TRAVELLER skill, and has learned each of those way points.  The computer will determine (approx) the shortest route from WayPoint A to WayPoint B.  If the path becomes blocked or someone attacks the TRAVELLER, then the traveling stops in that room.  Note: You can only initiate the TRAVELLER skill from a WayPoint.
2)	Seapoints—A sea based auto-travelling system.
