<P><STRONG><STRONG><FONT color=royalblue size=6>Introduction to 
Scripting</FONT></STRONG>&nbsp;</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Scripting is the ability to makes something behave proactively, or 
respond to game stimuli, in a way specified by the game builders.&nbsp; A Script 
is the set of commands written by the builders to perform this function.&nbsp; 
I</STRONG><STRONG>n CoffeeMud, any object may be scripted.&nbsp; This means 
that&nbsp;rooms, areas, items, and especially MOBs can be 
scripted.&nbsp;</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Scripting is accomplished through the Scriptable 
Behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;Giving an object this&nbsp;behavior makes it capable of 
running scripts on its behalf.&nbsp; The parameters of the Scriptable behavior 
define the&nbsp;source of the script itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>The most common parameter for the Scriptable behavior is the LOAD 
command, which specifies a text file containing the script.&nbsp; The syntax for 
this is as follows:</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><EM>load=path/file name</EM></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>The starting path for the Scriptable behavior is the resources 
directory in your CoffeeMud package.&nbsp; Any further paths will branch from 
that directory.&nbsp; The file specified is&nbsp;a text file containing the 
script.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>A less common&nbsp;way to specify a script for the Scriptable 
behavior is to enter the script itself into the parameter.&nbsp;&nbsp; Scripts 
entered in this way differ significantly from scripts entered into text files 
for the LOAD command in one significant sense: Every line of a script entered in 
this way must be terminated by a semicolon.&nbsp; Here is an 
example.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><EM>RAND_PROG 50;bounce;say "hi!";~;</EM>&nbsp;</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Scripts which are entered into text files for the LOAD parameter have 
their lines terminated by carriage returns (ENTER) instead of semicolons.&nbsp; 
The script&nbsp;syntax&nbsp;is, in all other ways, identical.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Those who are familiar with the mobprog scripting language in other 
mud codebases will have no trouble picking up on the CoffeeMud scripting 
language.&nbsp; In fact, most of your existing scripts will probably work 
without requireing changes.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=royalblue size=6> Script 
Structure</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>The CoffeeMud scripting language is an "event-based" 
language<STRONG>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each script&nbsp;may contain one or more event 
"triggers".&nbsp; Each trigger defines the conditions of its occurrance on a 
single line.&nbsp;&nbsp;This line is followed by&nbsp;commands underneath it 
which are executed only when the trigger event occurs.&nbsp; 
</STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>Each event trigger/command grouping is terminated by a 
~ character, which should appear on a line by itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</STRONG><STRONG>Putting this together, we have a high level syntax that looks 
like this:</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><EM>EVENT_TRIGGER&nbsp; parameter1 parameter2 
...<BR>command1<BR>command2<BR>...<BR>commandN</EM><BR></STRONG><STRONG><EM>~ANOTHER_EVENT_TRIGGER&nbsp; parameter1 parameter2 
...<BR>command1<BR>command2<BR>...<BR>commandN</EM><BR><EM>~</EM></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>etc.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=royalblue size=6>Scripting Events</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Below are a list of the valid event triggers, 
along with their parameters, and a description of the events or circumstances 
under which the events occur.&nbsp; These docs borrow heavily from the nicely 
written MOBPROG Tutorial at </STRONG><A

<P class=MsoNormal><STRONG>Usage:<BR></STRONG><STRONG><EM>greet_prog [integer 
percentage]</EM></STRONG></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><STRONG>This type of mobprog checks a percentage chance every 
time someone enters the room that the mob is currently in. If the random number 
generated between 1 and 100 is equal to or below the percentage of the 
greet_prog, the prog is triggered. Note that greet_progs are triggered by both 
players and mobs, and a mob in a maze can actually sometimes end up triggering 
itself! This type of mobprog has all sorts of uses, ranging from giving in-zone 
quest information to people entering the room, creating aggressive progs, etc. 
It is a good idea to use the if isqueued function in greet_progs to cut down on 
spam when multiple players enter the room at the same time.</STRONG></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><STRONG>EXAMPLES:<BR><EM><BR>greet_prog 25</EM><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>(This prog will be triggered 
25% of the time when someone </STRONG><STRONG>enters the room where the mob 
currently is.)</STRONG></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><STRONG><EM>greet_prog 100</EM><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>(This prog will be triggered 
100% of the time when someone </STRONG><STRONG>enters the room where the mob 
currently is. This means </STRONG><STRONG>every time.)</STRONG></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><STRONG>SPECIAL NOTES: You’ll probably want to do a large 
number of if checks in greet_progs, specifically in the difference between mobs 
and player characters. Note that greet_progs will trigger&nbsp;even if a person 
is sneaking, though the mob must have detect invisibility to see invisible 
people, infravision to see people in the dark, sense sneaking to see sneakers, 
and will not see people if blinded.</STRONG><SPAN

<P class=MsoNormal><STRONG>Usage:<BR></STRONG><EM><STRONG>act_prog [trigger 
message]<BR>act_prog p [trigger message]&nbsp;<o:p></O:P></STRONG></EM></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><STRONG>This type of mobprog will trigger when the mob sees a 
certain string of text. When the 'p' is inserted into the trigger line, the 
string of text must be precise, while if it is not, any of the words in the list 
can trigger the mobprog. This type of mobprog has many uses, one of which is 
communication between mobs. There are a few socials which create a message only 
to the person performing them and to the one receiving them.&nbsp; You can use 
these and act_progs to safely have mobs trigger each other, without people 
seeing what is going on. Other uses include triggering off of people fleeing, 
moving out of the room, etc. The possibilities are endless.</STRONG></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><STRONG>EXAMPLES:</STRONG></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><STRONG><EM>act_prog wolf dog coyote</EM><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>(This will trigger whenever 
the mob sees a segment of text containing any of the words wolf, dog, or<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>coyote. If the string contains more than 
one of these, the prog will be triggered multiple times.)</STRONG></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><STRONG><EM>act_prog p A wolf howls at the moon.</EM><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>(This will trigger the prog 
when it sees this precise message. Note that punctuation is important here as 
well.)</STRONG></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><STRONG>MULTIPLE PROGS: You can have more than one act_prog 
on a mob, but you shouldn’t have multiple act_progs that trigger off of the same 
message.</STRONG></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><STRONG>SPECIAL NOTES: ANSI colors on objects don’t seem to 
work well with act_progs, so avoid using ANSI colors in anything that may be 
part of your act_prog trigger. Variables are not used in act_progs, so do not 
try to use them; it won’t work.</STRONG></P>

style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; COLOR: blue; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><STRONG>bribe_prog</STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><STRONG>Usage:<BR><EM>bribe_prog [integer money 
value]</EM></STRONG></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><STRONG>This type of mobprog is triggered when a value of 
money is given to the mob. If the amount of money is equal to or more than the 
integer money value of the bribe_prog, the prog will go off. If it is less than 
the value of the bribe_prog, it will not go off. This type of prog is normally 
used for in-zone quests, perhaps bribing guards to let a prisoner free or 
bribing a bartender to give you some information. It can also be used for 
larger, special mob behavior, such as a ferryman who will move a player to 
another spot in the world for a fee.</STRONG></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><STRONG>EXAMPLES:</STRONG></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><STRONG><EM>bribe_prog 1</EM><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>(This bribe_prog will 
trigger whenever the mob is given an amount of gold equal to or greater than 1 
coin. Of course, this means that the prog will be triggered if any amount of 
money is given to the mob at all.)<BR 
style="mso-special-character: line-break"><BR 
style="mso-special-character: line-break"><EM>bribe_prog 500</EM><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>(This bribe_prog will 
trigger if someone gives the mob an&nbsp;<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>amount of money equal to or greater than 500 coins.)</STRONG></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><STRONG>&nbsp;MULTIPLE PROGS: You can have multiple 
bribe_progs on the same mob. However, these must be listed in order from largest 
gold amount to smallest gold amount. So if you have a bribe_prog 250 and a 
bribe_prog 100, the 250 must be listed first, and then the 100. If you don’t do 
this your larger sum bribe_progs will never be triggered.</STRONG></P>

<P class=MsoNormal><STRONG>This type of mobprog is triggered by the 
mob&nbsp;eating or drinking from an object. If the object&nbsp;used&nbsp;by the 
mob matches the keywords of the consume_prog, the prog is triggered. If there is 
a ‘p’ placed before the keyword list, the keywords of the object must exactly 
match that of the consume_prog. If there is not, then any object with any of the
