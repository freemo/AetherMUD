<P align=left><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><FONT size=3>The heroics game will 
essentially be an engine whereby classless/leveless players take on goals 
assigned by the system on behalf of a faction.&nbsp; Completing the goal will 
allow the player to gain favor with that faction, and lose favor with rival 
factions.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P align=left><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><FONT 
size=3><STRONG>Goals</STRONG></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P align=left><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><FONT size=3>The most common goal 
for players will be the solving of certain logic problems generated by the 
system, which are based around both engine generated characters, as well as mobs 
already in the game Area.&nbsp; The logic problems, also called "mysteries", 
will take many different forms, depending on the nature of the faction that 
assigns them.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P align=left><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><FONT size=3>Example goals for a 
"city hall" faction might include: Solving a murder mystery, solving a robbery, 
uncovering corruption.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P align=left><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><FONT size=3>Solving these larger 
goals will involve the answering of specific questions via the use of 
cluse.&nbsp; Examples of the types of questions one must answer to complete a 
goal might include: WHO knows something, WHO did something, WHO are relatives, 
WHERE did they do something, WHERE are they now, With WHAT did they do 
something, WHO they work for, or are working for.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P align=left><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><FONT size=3>Answering these 
questions then becomes the basis for the more specific goal-oriented quests 
which must be solved by the players to gain favor with the 
faction.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P align=left><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><FONT size=3>Example of the use of 
specific question-related goals for an "underworld" faction might include: Who 
witnessed one of their crimes? Who has talked to the police (so you can go 
punish them?)&nbsp;What clues did&nbsp;a villaint&nbsp;leave behind? Who is a 
heroes leading lady? Who is a heroes family? Where does the leading lady/family 
work/live.&nbsp;What is a heroes secret identity.&nbsp;Who are the bribable 
police, and how much will they take. Who makes the parts you need for your 
secret weapon,&nbsp;or&nbsp;who knows how to make the parts you need?&nbsp; 
</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P align=left><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><FONT size=3>Goals can also be 
complex.&nbsp; For instance, if the underworld wants a secret weapon built, it 
might set up intermediate goals such as:&nbsp; aquiring&nbsp;money for 
protection (who is bribabble?), who makes the parts, who knows how to make 
it.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P align=left><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><FONT 
size=3><STRONG>Clues</STRONG></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P align=left><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><FONT size=3>The answering of the 
questions involved in accomplishing the goals of a faction is accomplished by 
uncovering and logically deducing from information provided by the system in the 
form of clues.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P align=left><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><FONT size=3>Every mystery will 
begin with a dialog from a faction.&nbsp; The dialog usually involves telling 
the player either what has happened, or what is happening, or perhaps what needs 
to happen.&nbsp; </FONT></SPAN></P>
<P align=left><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><FONT size=3>The system will then 
generate the appropriate questions which need to be answered in order to solve 
the mystery.&nbsp; From there, the system will generate numerous acceptable and 
possible answers to the questions (suspects for a WHO question, places for a 
WHERE question, items for a WHAT question, etc).&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, the system 
will generate clues of various sorts which either help to answer a question 
directly, or answer it indirectly by making all answers but the correct one 
impossible.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P align=left><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><FONT size=3>Types of clues 
include:&nbsp; </FONT></SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><FONT 
size=3>Contaminants (blood stains, mud stains, smells, being wet, being deaf 
because of noise, weather-related), </FONT></SPAN><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><FONT size=3>Reputation (weapons usually used, places 
usually gone, people usually known, things known to believe, phobias), Witnesses 
(weapons seen with, places seen, people seen with, things heard said), and 
Gotchas (Phobia, Pressure/Confrontation, Being a witness yourself, Items owned, 
Glove that fit, Footprints, fingerprints) </FONT></SPAN></P>
<P align=left><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><FONT size=3>Depending on the 
difficulty level, the system might also generate anti-clues or deceptions 
regarding the true answer.&nbsp; This can include </FONT></SPAN><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><FONT size=3>disguises&nbsp;to deceive&nbsp;witnesses, 
lies&nbsp;to deceive&nbsp;reputations, item-plants&nbsp;to 
deceive&nbsp;contaminants.&nbsp; What dealing with deceptions, however, the 
system will be careful to generate enough proper and correct clues to overcome 
deceptions.&nbsp; For instance, if a witness is set to lie about an answer, at 
least two other witnesses will give the correct answer to overcome the 
lie.&nbsp; A deceptive item plant will be overcome by at least two other 
contaminant clues which point to the proper answer, and so 
forth.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P align=left><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><FONT size=3>Uncovering clues will 
involve doing things such as: Asking questions of witness mobs, who will answer 
according to what they have been assigned to know and say.&nbsp; Finding 
contaminants by searching or examining items and places, and possibly performing 
gotchas by exposing suspects to objects of their phobias, or having them try on 
a glove.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P align=left><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><STRONG><FONT size=3>Solving the 
Mystery</FONT></STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P align=left><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><FONT size=3>Once the answers to the 
appropriate questions have been uncovered in the allotted time, they are 
delivered to the head of the faction which requested the mystery.&nbsp; If the 
answers are correct, the mystery is solved and an appropriate dialog is given to 
wrap up the mystery.&nbsp; At this point the player is 
rewarded.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P align=left><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><FONT size=3>Rewards will include: 
gaining favor with the faction that assigned the mystery, the assignment of more 
interesting and complex problems from the faction, finding the faction 
more&nbsp;helpful in combat or at least non-hostile, getting better prices in 
faction shops, gaining interesting tecipes for common skills, gaining henchmen 
(for villians, they tank, and are very weak),&nbsp;gaining leading ladies or 
suiters, and gaining sidekicks (they get more powerful, but fewer of them than 
henchmen).</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P align=left><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><FONT size=3>The engine should 
maintain a static state of all area maps, while still keeping a small level of 
realism.&nbsp; For murdered or captured mobs, this should involve only changing 
the names of the affected mobs according to an engine formula.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P align=left><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><STRONG><FONT size=3>Player 
Interaction</FONT></STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P align=left><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><FONT size=3>Each player that plays 
the heroics game will select a superhero with the appropriate superpowers.&nbsp; 
These powers will not be overwhelmingly useful in solving the mysteries, but may 
help with tertiary encounters or with just getting around the map.&nbsp; The 
player will also select a secret identity.&nbsp; When in this secret identity 
form, they are effectively protected harassment by those in favor of rival 
factions, but also gain no benefit from harassing others themselves.&nbsp; 
Players using their secret identity may have an easier time getting questions 
answered from witnesses of rival factions than they do in their superhero form, 
but generally would have more trouble getting any witness to talk at ALL.&nbsp; 
After all, it is intimidating to be a super hero.&nbsp; </FONT></SPAN></P>
<P align=left><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><FONT size=3>Players can play an 
active role in each others attempts to solve the mysteries.&nbsp; When a player 
solves a mystery, he is the only one who benefits.&nbsp; However, when a player 
fails to solve a mystery, ALL players in favor with rival factions 
benefit.&nbsp; This means that it is in the benefit of players to try and thwart 
a players attempt to solve a mystery.&nbsp; This may be done by tampering with 
evidence or witnesses, or by harassing the player directly.&nbsp; 
</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P align=left><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><FONT size=3>Players should be set 
only to go unconscious on death.&nbsp;&nbsp; Players rendered so by other 
players will not only gain favor with factions that rival the defeated one, but 
will lose faction with the defeated players Personal faction, named after 
themselves.&nbsp; Factions of this kind can be used to determine arch enemies, 
and track rival hero information.</FONT></SPAN></P>

size=3>The tech/sci-fi engine will&nbsp;fascilitate a game whereby the players 
travel to different planets in space ships in order to accumulate wealth.&nbsp; 
The wealth can be accumulated through the trading of goods, the accomplishing of 
goals or quests, or through piracy.&nbsp; The wealth is then used to upgrade the 
players technology; e.g. better ships, better weapons, better components, which 
will aid them in more easily acquiring more wealth.</FONT></SPAN></SPAN></P>
