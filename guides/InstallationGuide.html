<FONT size=6>Installing and Using<BR><STRONG>  
 CoffeeMud 3.0</STRONG></FONT></SPAN></B></P>
<IMG src="images/zip.jpg">
<P><STRONG><FONT size=5>Installation:</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>The first and most critical step in installing CoffeeMud 
3.0 is to make sure that you have downloaded and installed the latest version of the Sun Java JDK.&nbsp; As of this 
writing, that version is Java 1.4.0.&nbsp; CoffeeMud uses the latest Sun 
classes, so stay up to date!</P>
<P>The&nbsp;second step in installing CoffeeMud 3.0 is to unpack the 
CoffeeMud.zip package into a directory on your hard drive.&nbsp; This directory 
may be called, for instance, "CoffeeMud".</P>
<P align=center><STRONG><FONT size=6>Congratulations!</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left>You have successfully installed CoffeeMud.&nbsp; </P>
<P align=left>You may wish, at this point, to investigate the settings and 
components of the CoffeeMud server.&nbsp; If so, by all means, finish reading 
this document.&nbsp; If you couldn't care less, then go into the your CoffeeMud 
directory on a command line and enter:</P>
<P align=left><STRONG>java 
-Xms25535000 -Xmx85535000 com.planet_ink.coffee_mud.application.MUD&nbsp;"Your Muds 
Name"</STRONG></P>
<P align=left>          
              
           
              
        This will start up the CoffeeMud 
server.&nbsp;Remember to change the "Your Muds Name" text at the end to the unique name 
you want to give your mud.</P>
<P align=left>Now, connect to the server on port&nbsp;4444 using your telnet or 
other MUD client.&nbsp; Create yourself a new character.&nbsp; This new 
character will be your administrative player, or Archon, so most of the player 
settings, such as class, race, stats, etc. won't matter much.&nbsp; When your 
character logs in for the first time, you will see a book in a room.&nbsp; Your 
player should pick up the book and read it.&nbsp; The commands to do this 
are:</P>
<P align=left>get book</P>
<P align=left>read book</P>
<P align=left>Doing this will turn your player into an Archon.&nbsp; An Archon 
is an all-powerful administrative player who is capable of all manner of magical 
conjurations.&nbsp; If you are happy and ready to start making maps and other 
such nonsense, you may want to switch to reading the Archon's Guide, which is 
also part of the guides package in CoffeeMud.&nbsp; If you would like to learn a 
little more about Archon abilities first, however, you may want to finish 
reading this document.</P>
<IMG src="images/settings.jpg">
<P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=5>Settings:</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left>All of the general purpose settings for the 
CoffeeMud server are kept in the INI file, called "coffeemud.ini".&nbsp; This 
file may be modified with your favorite text editor: notepad, vi, emacs, 
copycon, Whatever!&nbsp; </P>
<P align=left>If you are happy with the standard 
installation, you will usually also be content to leave the INI file 
alone.&nbsp; You will eventually, however, probably find a need to at least modify the "START" 
setting.&nbsp; Any changes to the coffeemud.ini file will require that CoffeeMud 
be restarted (see the section on "CoffeeMud Administration") before the changes will 
take effect. </P>
<P align=left><EM>SYSMSGS, ERRMSGS, DBGMSGS<BR></EM>These entries refer to 
logged system messages, logged error messages, and logged debug messages 
respectively.&nbsp; When logging is directed to a file, that file is called 
"mud.log".&nbsp; The possible values for each of these settings is either "ON", 
which will direct the indicated messages to the screen only, "OFF" to disable 
the messages entirely, "FILE" to direct the messages to the "mud.log" file only, 
or "BOTH" for both screen and file output.&nbsp; By default, SYSMSGS and ERRMSGS 
are set to "BOTH", while DBGMSGS is set to "OFF".</P>
<P align=left><EM>PORT<BR></EM>This is the TCP/IP port number which the main 
CoffeeMud server will listen on.&nbsp; By default the setting is 4444.&nbsp; If 
you would like to change this number to some other port, you may do so!&nbsp; 
<BR><BR><EM>START<BR></EM>This setting designates the Room ID of the place on 
your map where new players will start off at.&nbsp; It also dictates where 
players are brought to when the Recall skill is used.&nbsp; By default, an 
arbitary room ID has been assigned.&nbsp; Once you've put together a few areas, 
you had better update this setting before new players start 
arriving.<BR><BR><EM>CHANNELS<BR></EM>This is a comma 
seperated list of channels which the users of your system may converse publicly 
on.&nbsp; An miminum character level may optionally be specified after each 
channel name. &nbsp;The channel names given here are completely arbitrary and 
may be meaningful or whimsical terms, though the names may not contains 
spaces.&nbsp; A couple of standard channels are specified.&nbsp; The limit for 
the number of standard channels plus any InterMud channels (see <EM>I3CHANNELS 
</EM>        
             
            
            
below) is 16 or 32, I forget.<BR><BR><EM>BACKLOG</EM> <BR>This TCP/IP setting 
denotes how many connections can be queued up when the server is busy. Leave it 
at 6.&nbsp; </P>
<P align=left><EM>BIND</EM> <BR>This TCP/IP setting will limit the IP addresses 
which can connect to your server.&nbsp; It is commented out by default, which 
means that everyone is allowed to connect.&nbsp; Leave it that 
way.<BR><EM><BR>RUNI3SERVER<BR></EM>This setting tells CoffeeMud 
whether to start up the built-in&nbsp;InterMud3 server and make a connection to 
the InterMud router.&nbsp; A value of "TRUE" will turn on the I3 server and make 
the connection.<BR><BR><EM>I3PORT<BR></EM>This is the TCP/IP port number which 
the main&nbsp;InterMud3 server will listen on.&nbsp; By default the setting is 
27766.&nbsp; If you would like to change this number to some other port, you may 
do so.&nbsp; If the <EM>RUNI3SERVER </EM>entry above is FALSE, this setting will 
have no effect.<BR><BR><EM>I3STATE<BR></EM>This is a 
short description of the state of your mud as you want it published to the I3 
network.&nbsp; A state is typically like "Private", or "Open to the public", or 
"Under Construction", etc.<BR><BR><EM>I3CHANNELS<BR></EM>This is a comma seperated list of 
InterMud3 channels which the users of your system may converse publicly 
on.&nbsp; Each channel entry is seperated by a comma.&nbsp; Each entry consists 
of a locate channel name (no spaces in the name), followed by a space, followed 
by a minimum character level to view or chat on the channel, followed by&nbsp; a 
space, followed by the name of the InterMud3 channel to map this local channel 
to.&nbsp; A couple of standard channels are specified.&nbsp; The limit for the 
number of standard channels (see <EM>CHANNELS </EM>above) plus any InterMud 
channels&nbsp; is 16 or 32, I forget.<BR><BR><EM>RUNWEBSERVERS<BR></EM>This setting tells CoffeeMud whether to 
start up the built-in web servers.&nbsp; A value of "TRUE" will turn on the web 
servers.&nbsp; Even if you don't wish to publish any of your MUDs information to 
the web, you may want to run the Admin web server so that you can use the 
MUDGrinder area editing tool.&nbsp; See the MUDGrinder Guide (MUDGrinder.html)
for more information on this tool.&nbsp; For more information on the CoffeeMud 
web server in general, please read the WebServer Guide 
(WebServer.html).<BR><BR><EM>ITEMS, MOBS, BEHAVIORS, ABILITIES, CHARCLASSES, RACES, 
COMMANDS, LOCALES, AREAS, EXITS</EM> <BR>These settings 
each specify a path on your local drive which will contain Java class 
files.&nbsp; These class files are typically classes which you might want to use 
with your CoffeeMud system, but which are not included with the standard 
CoffeeMud distribution.&nbsp;</P>
<P align=left><EM>DBCLASS<BR></EM>This specifies the name of the Java class 
which will be used as your&nbsp;JDBC or ODBC database driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you 
are using a System ODBC data&nbsp;source, this entry will typically be 
"sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver".&nbsp;&nbsp;By default, however, the CoffeeMud 
"fakedb" package is&nbsp;installed.&nbsp; The driver name for this class is 
"com.planet_ink.fakedb.Driver".&nbsp; See the next section on "The CoffeeMud 
Database" for more information.<BR><BR><EM>DBSERVICE</EM> <BR>This is the name 
of the JDBC or ODBC Service as defined by your local operating system.&nbsp; It 
typically denotes the name of the ODBC service, or the name of the database in 
other instances.&nbsp; For a System&nbsp;ODBC service, this value will typically 
look like "jdbc:odbc:SystemServiceName".&nbsp; By default, however, the fakedb 
package is used.&nbsp; The format of the service name for fakedb is 
"jdbc:fakedb:DataPath".&nbsp; Where DataPath is a local drive path containing 
the "fakedb.schema" file, where your flat data files will be created.&nbsp; See 
the section on "The CoffeeMud Database" for more information.<BR><BR><EM>DBUSER, 
DBPASS <BR></EM>This specifies the name and password which may or may not be 
required to log into your ODBC service, or database.&nbsp; Not required for 
fakedb, and thus blank by default.</P>
<P align=left><EM>DBCONNECTIONS<BR></EM>This &nbsp;is the number of independent 
connections to make to the database through your JDBC/ODBC driver.&nbsp; 1 or 2 
is plenty.&nbsp; CoffeeMud is not&nbsp;especially database 
intensive.<P>
<IMG src="images/db.jpg">
<P><STRONG><FONT size=5>The CoffeeMud Database:</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left>CoffeeMud requires a database for 
operation.&nbsp; A database is simply the place where all the rooms, items, 
monsters, players, pets, and other information is stored on the computer.&nbsp; 
Without the database, you would have to start all over from scratch every time 
you booted the MUD Server.&nbsp; And we all know that would be bad.</P>
<P align=left>By default, CoffeeMud uses a custom JDBC flat-file database called 
"fakedb".&nbsp; FakeDB stores its data into text formatted files inside the 
"data" directory of your CoffeeMud package.&nbsp; FakeDB is rather slow, and 
hardly a powerful or professional database system, but it is quite sufficient 
for CoffeeMud, and performs well the small tasks it was designed for.&nbsp; </P>
<P align=left>For the more adventurous, CoffeeMud supports any JDBC or ODBC compliant 
database system.&nbsp; This includes such systems as Microsoft Access, Microsoft 
SQL Server, PostGRE SQL, MySQL, Oracle, and others.&nbsp; While this document 
cannot cover the step by step installation instructions for each of these 
systems, it can be pointed out that everything you need has been provided.&nbsp; 
Inside the "guides/database/" directory of your CoffeeMud package, 
you will find four files: "coffeemuddb.sql", "coffeemuddb2.sql", "coffeemuddbmysql.sql", and 
"fakedb.schema".&nbsp; The first three are SQL Scripts which can be used to create 
the necessary tables in Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, Access, and some of 
the others.&nbsp; The last is a copy of the same fakedb file from your "data" 
directory, in case it becomes corrupted.&nbsp; Although the manner in which the 
SQL Scripts are used may differ from system to system, they cannot all be 
covered here.&nbsp; Some of the scripts may need to be changed slightly to work 
with some systems.&nbsp; Some systems will require each SQL Statement be issued 
independently instead of as part of a larger script.&nbsp; Please consult your 
database documentation for more information on this.</P>
<P align=left>In order to use your database with CoffeeMud, as specified in the 
section on Settings, you must provide CoffeeMud with a JDBC compliant Driver 
class.&nbsp; In many cases, you will be creating a System ODBC Data 
Source.&nbsp; When this is the case, the driver "sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver" 
may be used to access the database.&nbsp; Some systems, however, such as MySQL, 
and Microsoft SQL Server 2000, have native JDBC Drivers which may be used 
instead of the general ODBC Driver.&nbsp; These native JDBC Drivers tend to be 
far superior to their ODBC counterparts, and are highly recommended.</P>
<P align=left>The care and feeding of the tables used by CoffeeMud should be 
very low.&nbsp; The database will grow along with the areas created, and along 
with the number of players which join your MUD.&nbsp; All of this growth can be 
managed, however, within CoffeeMud itself, by your Archon administrative 
user.&nbsp; You should not need to, nor should you attempt to affect individual 
rows in your database for any reason.</P>
<P align=left>&nbsp;</P>
<IMG src="images/mug.jpg">
<P align=left><FONT size=5><STRONG>CoffeeMud Administration:</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT>The administration 
of your CoffeeMud server is done from within the game server itself, when you 
are logged in as your Archon player.&nbsp; You may use "ahelp" and "atopics" to 
see a list of some Archon specific functionality.&nbsp; Many of these commands 
are discussed in depth in the Archon's Guide (ArchonGuide.html).&nbsp; Here are 
a few highlights of the Archon commands:</FONT></P>
<P align=left><EM>SHUTDOWN<BR></EM>Although CoffeeMud can 
also be brought down by killing the Java virtual machine, the proper way to shut 
down CoffeeMud is by entering the shutdown command.&nbsp; This will ensure that 
all users are saved back to disk, and that the system goes down in a polite and 
orderly manner.&nbsp; This is also the command which should be used when changes 
are made to your "coffeemud.ini" file.&nbsp; Changes to your INI file do not 
take affect until your server is restarted.</P>
<P align=left><EM>LIST<BR></EM>The Archon is able to list 
lots of different things, for many different reasons.&nbsp; "list users" will 
show you all of the players, and when they logged on last.&nbsp; This is useful 
for weeding out olde players (see DESTROY below).&nbsp; "list sessions" will 
show you a list of all active players.&nbsp; "list threads" will show you how 
many Java threads are active.&nbsp; "list ticks" will show you all the objects 
making use of those threads! "list reports" will who you your resource usage.</P>
<P align=left><EM>TAKE<BR></EM>Use this command if a player 
or monster has something that doesn't belong to them, and you need it back.</P>
<P align=left><EM>POSSESS<BR></EM>Easily the most fun part 
of being an Archon is to possess one of the monsters and harass the players, 
making them think the monsters have truely come to life!</P>
<P align=left><EM>ORDER<BR></EM>Although any player may 
order around their followers, an Archon can order ANYONE to do ANYTHING.</P>
<P align=left><EM>UNLOAD<BR></EM>If you've made any 
changes to your help files or other resources, and don't want to have to reboot the whole MUD, you 
can use this command as a short-cut.</P>
<P align=left><EM>DUMPFILE<BR></EM>When you want to view 
some text file on your system through the MUD.</P>
<P align=left><EM>WIZINV<BR></EM>Sometimes an Archon wants a 
little privacy, and this command gives it to him or her.&nbsp; It will make the 
Archon completely undetectable, allowing free movement without harassment from 
players or monsters.</P>
<P align=left><EM>RESET<BR></EM>Giving a parameter of "room" 
or "area", this command will make everything reset back to the state it was last 
saved at.</P>
<P align=left><EM>GOTO<BR></EM>Allows the Archon to zap him 
or herself directly to the room or mob of his or her choice.&nbsp; The argument is a 
valid Room ID, room name, mob name, or area name.</P>
<P align=left><EM>SNOOP<BR></EM>This command 
can let you watch other players as they wander your world.</P>
<P align=left><EM>WHERE<BR></EM>Allows the Archon to who all is online, and
where they are on the map.  An argument may be given to specify a specific mob name.</P>
<P align=left><EM>EXPORT<BR></EM>If you need a backup to 
your database, you can save your areas one at a time as files, for reimportation 
in the event of a disaster.</P>
<P align=left><EM>IMPORT<BR></EM>In addition to allowing the 
reimportation of areas saved using EXPORT, IMPORT will also take in area files 
from other MUDs, such as ROM, CircleMUD, and others.&nbsp; The ROM format is by 
far the best supported, however.</P>
<P align=left><EM>GENCHAR<BR></EM>Although it's not a vital 
administration tool, CharGen can be used to take a glimpse of what the "typical" 
user of a particular class might look like.&nbsp; This can be a helpful aid in 
the construction of monsters, perhaps.</P>
<P align=left><EM>SAVE<BR></EM>This command, depending on 
the argument, can update the players data, or can make aspects of the Archons 
room permanent by saving it to the database.</P>
<P align=left><EM>CREATE<BR></EM>Depending on the argument, 
this command can bring almost anything into existence, from rooms to doors, from 
monsters to items.</P>
<P align=left><EM>COPY<BR></EM>Depending on the argument, 
this command can make copies of almost anything in your mud, 
from rooms to monsters and items.</P>
<P align=left><EM>MODIFY<BR></EM>If something which exists 
is not quite right, this command can make it right.</P>
<P align=left><EM>DESTROY<BR></EM>Last but not least, this 
powerful command can be used to banish objects and mobs, rooms and areas, or 
even players -- permanently.&nbsp; A&nbsp; player (user) need not be online to 
be destroyed.</P>
