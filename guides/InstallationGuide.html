<FONT size=6>Installing and Using<BR><STRONG>  
 CoffeeMud 4.1</STRONG></FONT></SPAN></B></P>
<IMG src="images/zip.jpg">
<P><STRONG><FONT size=5>Installation:</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>The first and most critical step in installing CoffeeMud 
4.0 is to make sure that you have downloaded and installed the latest version of 
the Sun Java J2SDK.&nbsp; As of this writing, that version is Java 1.4.1.&nbsp; CoffeeMud uses the 
latest Sun classes, so stay up to date!&nbsp; If you are using some flavor of Unix or Linux instead of Windows, make 
sure you aren't trying to get by with GCJ -- CoffeeMud 
(and Sun) do not support it.</P>
<P>Now, if you are upgrading from a previous version of CoffeeMud, you need to stop 
here and skip ahead to the section on upgrading.&nbsp; If this 
is your first installation, keep reading.</P>
<P>You will now need to&nbsp;unpack the CoffeeMud.zip package into a directory 
on your hard drive.&nbsp; This directory may be called, for instance, 
"CoffeeMud".</P>
<P>If you are using a UNIX/Linux system, you should now bring up a console and 
cd to whatever directory you unpacked CoffeeMud to.&nbsp; Make sure you can 
write to mudUNIX.sh by issung the the command <STRONG>chmod 766 
mudUNIX.sh&nbsp;</STRONG>&nbsp; Now,&nbsp;enter&nbsp;<STRONG>sh 
InstallUNIX.sh</STRONG>&nbsp; Follow the prompts by inputting the directory of 
JAVA; do not enter a trailing slash, for instance: 
<STRONG>/opt/j2sdk/j2sdk1.4.2</STRONG>&nbsp; Continue following the prompts: 
Say&nbsp;<STRONG>y</STRONG> if you want to compile the main 
program,&nbsp;<STRONG>n</STRONG> if you don't. Enter the name of your new MUD 
(this only works FIRST RUN; you cannot use this to change MUD's name in the 
FUTURE). Say&nbsp;<STRONG>y</STRONG> if you want to start your MUD now, and 
<STRONG>n</STRONG> if you don't. Hit enter after the nohup comes up.&nbsp; Send 
an email to <A href="mailto:wrichter@att.net">wrichter@att.net</A> or <A 
href="mailto:bo@zimmers.net">bo@zimmers.net</A> if you have any problems with 
this script.</P>
<P align=center><STRONG><FONT size=6>Congratulations!</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left>You have successfully installed CoffeeMud.&nbsp; </P>
<P align=left>You may wish, at this point, to investigate the settings and 
components of the CoffeeMud server.&nbsp; If so, by all means, finish reading 
this document.&nbsp; If you couldn't care less, then go into the your CoffeeMud 
directory on a command line and enter:</P>
<P align=left><STRONG>java -classpath "." 
-Xms25535000</STRONG> <STRONG>-Xmx85535000 
com.planet_ink.coffee_mud.application.MUD&nbsp;"Your Muds Name"</STRONG></P>
<P align=left>          
              
           
              
        This will start up the CoffeeMud 
server.&nbsp;Remember to change the "Your Muds Name" text at the end to the 
unique name you want to give your mud.&nbsp; If you are running Windows, you 
might also get away with first modifying the file mud.bat using Notepad, and 
then&nbsp;executing that&nbsp;file.&nbsp; If you are running some flavor of 
FreeBSD, Unix, or Linux, you also have a mudLINUX.sh you may first modify, then 
make executable using the command <STRONG>chmod 755 mudLINUX.sh, </STRONG>          
              
           
              
              
               
   and then execute.</P>
<P align=left>Now, connect to the server on port&nbsp;5555 using your telnet or 
other MUD client.&nbsp; Create yourself a new character.&nbsp; This new 
character will be your administrative player, or Archon, so most of the player 
settings, such as class, race, stats, etc. won't matter much.&nbsp; When your 
character logs in for the first time, you will see a book in a room.&nbsp; Your 
player should pick up the book and read it.&nbsp; The commands to do this 
are:</P>
<P align=left>get book</P>
<P align=left>read book</P>
<P align=left>  Doing this will turn your player into an Archon.&nbsp; 
An Archon is an all-powerful administrative player who is capable of all manner 
of magical conjurations.&nbsp; If you are happy and ready to start making maps 
and other such nonsense, you may want to switch to reading the 
<A href="ArchonGuide.html">Archon's Guide</A>, 
which is also part of the guides package in CoffeeMud.&nbsp; You will probably want to 
import a bunch of areas into your database right away.&nbsp; If so, 
you should enter:</P>
<P align=left>           
             
             
              
               
            
 ahelp import</P>
<P align=left>           
             
             
              
          This will tell you how 
to import *.CMARE files, which are CoffeeMud formatted area files.&nbsp; Others are 
supported as well.</P>
<P align=left>           
             
             
    If you would like to learn a little more about 
Archon abilities or the system in general,&nbsp;you may want to finish reading this document.&nbsp; Otherwise, 
once you have your administrator and a few areas, you are technically 
ready to play!</P>

<P><STRONG><FONT size=5>Upgrading From a Previous Version of 
CoffeeMud</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>There are three upgrade paths,&nbsp;one&nbsp;where&nbsp;the database schema 
was not changed&nbsp;(4.0.0.0 to 4.0.1.0), and two others where the database 
schema was changed (i.e. 3.0 to 4.0)&nbsp;.&nbsp; If you are unsure, or don't 
know how to tell, go ahead and follow the changed database schema process.</P>
<P><EM>Unchanged Database Schema Process</EM></P>
<P>If you are upgrading to a version where the&nbsp;database schema has 
(presumably) not changed, you still must expect that many other things probably 
have.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, follow these steps:</P>
<P><STRONG>1.</STRONG> First go into the directory that contains your olde 
version of CoffeeMud and obliterate the entire "com" path.&nbsp; Just wipe it 
away.&nbsp; You won't need it, and it will just cause problems anyway.&nbsp; If 
you had any custom classes in there, you might want to pull them out first and 
copy them elsewhere.</P>
<P><STRONG>2.</STRONG> Next, save away (in another directory) your coffeemud.ini 
file, and perhaps your mud.bat or mudLINUX.bat .&nbsp; Also save away&nbsp;any 
files in the resources or web&nbsp;directory you might have customized to your 
mud, including perhaps your resources/text/intro.txt file for instance.</P>
<P><STRONG>3.</STRONG> Now unpack/unzip the new version of CoffeeMud on TOP of 
your olde one.</P>
<P><STRONG>4.</STRONG> Open up the coffeemud.ini file that comes with the new 
version and also open up your olde customized coffeemud.ini file you saved away 
in step 2.&nbsp; Copy over from the old&nbsp;ini file&nbsp;the settings that 
differ from the new one.&nbsp; The idea here is that the new coffeemud.ini file 
may contain new settings you need to be aware of.&nbsp; However, your old custom 
settings will still apply in the new version -- especially your database 
settings for instance.</P>
<P><STRONG>5.</STRONG> Copy your intro.txt on top of the one from the new 
build.&nbsp; As in step 4, merge any other files back into their counterparts in 
the new build.</P>
<P><STRONG>6. </STRONG>Smile, you are done.</P>
<P><EM>Changed FakeDB Database Schema Process</EM></P>
<P>If you are upgrading to a version with an updated database 
schema,&nbsp;follow the&nbsp;correct instructions for your database type.&nbsp; 
If you are using&nbsp;fakedb, follow the instructions below.&nbsp; If you don't 
know whether or not you are using fakedb, then you ARE using fakedb and should 
follow these instructions:</P>
<P><STRONG>1. </STRONG>Go into the CoffeeMud directory for your olde version and 
copy the entire "data" directory to somewhere else on your hard drive.&nbsp; 
Remember where you put it!</P>
<P><STRONG>2.</STRONG> To back to the beginning of this section and follow steps 
1 through 5 from the <EM>unchanged database schema</EM> process.</P>
<P><STRONG>3.&nbsp;</STRONG>From the command line, go into your CoffeeMud 
directory, and from there into the data directory.&nbsp; Delete all the files 
matching fakedb.data.*&nbsp; Do NOT delete the&nbsp;fakedb.schema! If everything 
went well, the new fakedb.schema from the new version of CoffeeMud is still in 
your data directory.&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>4.</STRONG> Still from the command line, go into your CoffeeMud 
directory and enter the following:</P>
<P><STRONG>java com.planet_ink.fakedb.DBUpgrade</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>5. </STRONG>Follow the instructions for this little program.</P>
<P><STRONG>6. </STRONG>Smile, you are done.</P>
<P><EM>Changed Database Schema Process (not FakeDB)</EM></P>
<P>Now, if you are upgrading to a version with an updated database schema and 
you are NOT using fakedb, but are using Access, SQL Server, MySQL, or some other 
database, follow these instructions:</P>
<P><STRONG>1.</STRONG> Go into the CoffeeMud directory for your olde version and 
copy the entire "data" directory to somewhere else on your hard drive.&nbsp; 
Remember where you put it!&nbsp; Even though you aren't using FakeBD, you will 
still need to copy FakeDB's&nbsp;schema for use with the upgrade 
application.</P>
<P><STRONG>2.</STRONG> To back to the beginning of this section and follow steps 
1 through 5 from the <EM>unchanged database schema</EM> 
process.</P>
<P><STRONG>3. </STRONG>Following the instructions provided by your database 
system, create a brand NEW database for the new version of 
CoffeeMud.&nbsp;&nbsp;You will need to use the appropriate database schema 
provided in the new version of CoffeeMud to do this.&nbsp; If you have forgotten 
what this means, consult the section of this document dealing with the CoffeeMud 
Database.&nbsp; Make sure you preserve your olde CoffeeMud database from the 
olde version!</P>
<P><STRONG>4. </STRONG>From the command line, go into your CoffeeMud directory 
and enter the following from the command line:</P>
<P><STRONG>java com.planet_ink.fakedb.DBUpgrade</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>5. </STRONG>Follow the instructions for this little program.</P>
<P><STRONG>6. </STRONG>Now open up your coffeemud.ini file and make any changes 
necessary to point CoffeeMud to the database for the new version.&nbsp; This may 
require creating a new ODBC data source, or just modifying the DBSERVICE line, 
depending on your database type.</P>
<P><STRONG>7. </STRONG>Smile, you are done.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>
<IMG src="images/settings.jpg"> </P>
<P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=5>Settings:</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left>All of the general purpose settings for the 
CoffeeMud server are kept in the INI file, called "coffeemud.ini".&nbsp; This 
file may be modified with your favorite text editor: notepad, vi, emacs, 
copycon, Whatever!&nbsp; If you are adventurous, you may also specify a custom 
ini file other than "coffeemud.ini" by putting a boot=        
 myfile.ini entry in your startup line just before the name 
of your mud.&nbsp; Why would you want to?&nbsp; I don't know, but 
you can. </P>
<P align=left>      If 
you are happy with the standard installation, you will usually also be 
content to leave the INI file alone.&nbsp; You will eventually, however, probably find a need 
to at least modify the "START" setting.&nbsp; Any changes to the 
coffeemud.ini file will require that CoffeeMud be restarted before the changes will 
take effect. </P>
<P align=left><EM>SYSMSGS, ERRMSGS, DBGMSGS<BR></EM>These entries refer to 
logged system messages, logged error messages, and logged debug messages 
respectively.&nbsp; When logging is directed to a file, that file is called 
"mud.log".&nbsp; The possible values for each of these settings is either "ON", 
which will direct the indicated messages to the screen only, "OFF" to disable 
the messages entirely, "FILE" to direct the messages to the "mud.log" file only, 
or "BOTH" for both screen and file output.&nbsp; By default, SYSMSGS and ERRMSGS 
are set to "BOTH", while DBGMSGS is set to "OFF".</P>
<P align=left><EM>PORT<BR></EM>This is the TCP/IP port number which the main 
CoffeeMud server will listen on.&nbsp; By default the setting is 5555.&nbsp; If 
you would like to change this number to some other port, you may do so!&nbsp; 
<BR><BR><EM>START<BR></EM>This setting designates the Room ID of the place on 
your map where new players will start off at.&nbsp; It also dictates where 
players are brought to when the Recall skill is used.&nbsp; By default, an 
arbitary room ID has been assigned.&nbsp; Once you've put together a few areas, 
you had better update this setting before new players start 
arriving.<BR><BR><EM>CHANNELS<BR></EM>This is a comma 
seperated list of channels which the users of your system may converse publicly 
on.&nbsp; An miminum character level may optionally be specified after each 
channel name. &nbsp;The channel names given here are completely arbitrary and 
may be meaningful or whimsical terms, though the names may not contains 
spaces.&nbsp; A couple of standard channels are specified.&nbsp; The limit for 
the number of standard channels plus any InterMud channels (see <EM>I3CHANNELS 
</EM>        
             
            
            
below) is 16 or 32, I forget.<BR><BR><EM>BACKLOG</EM> <BR>This TCP/IP setting 
denotes how many connections can be queued up when the server is busy. Leave it 
at 6.&nbsp; </P>
<P align=left><EM>BIND</EM> <BR>This TCP/IP setting will limit the IP addresses 
which can connect to your server.&nbsp; It is commented out by default, which 
means that everyone is allowed to connect.&nbsp; Leave it that 
way.<BR><EM><BR>RUNI3SERVER<BR></EM>This setting tells CoffeeMud 
whether to start up the built-in&nbsp;InterMud3 server and make a connection to 
the InterMud router.&nbsp; A value of "TRUE" will turn on the I3 server and make 
the connection.<BR><BR><EM>I3PORT<BR></EM>This is the TCP/IP port number which 
the main&nbsp;InterMud3 server will listen on.&nbsp; By default the setting is 
27766.&nbsp; If you would like to change this number to some other port, you may 
do so.&nbsp; If the <EM>RUNI3SERVER </EM>entry above is FALSE, this setting will 
have no effect.<BR><BR><EM>I3STATE<BR></EM>This is a 
short description of the state of your mud as you want it published to the I3 
network.&nbsp; A state is typically like "Private", or "Open to the public", or 
"Under Construction", etc.<BR><BR><EM>I3CHANNELS<BR></EM>This is a comma seperated list of 
InterMud3 channels which the users of your system may converse publicly 
on.&nbsp; Each channel entry is seperated by a comma.&nbsp; Each entry consists 
of a locate channel name (no spaces in the name), followed by a space, followed 
by a minimum character level to view or chat on the channel, followed by&nbsp; a 
space, followed by the name of the InterMud3 channel to map this local channel 
to.&nbsp; A couple of standard channels are specified.&nbsp; The limit for the 
number of standard channels (see <EM>CHANNELS </EM>above) plus any InterMud 
channels&nbsp; is 16 or 32, I forget.<BR><BR><EM>RUNWEBSERVERS<BR></EM>This setting tells CoffeeMud whether to 
start up the built-in web servers.&nbsp; A value of "TRUE" will turn on the web 
servers.&nbsp; Even if you don't wish to publish any of your MUDs information to 
the web, you may want to run the Admin web server so that you can use the 
MUDGrinder area editing tool.&nbsp; See the <A href="MUDGrinder.html">MUDGrinder Guide</A>
for more information on this tool.&nbsp; For more information on the CoffeeMud 
web server in general, please read the <A href="WebServer.html">WebServer Guide</A>.
<BR><BR><EM>ITEMS, MOBS, BEHAVIORS, ABILITIES, CHARCLASSES, RACES, 
COMMANDS, LOCALES, AREAS, EXITS</EM> <BR>These settings each 
specify a path on your local drive which will contain Java class files.&nbsp; 
These class files are typically classes which you might want to use with 
your CoffeeMud system, but which are not included with the standard CoffeeMud 
distribution.&nbsp;See the <A href="Programming.html">Programmer's Guide</A>
for more information on writing custom classes for CoffeeMud.</P>
<P align=left><EM>DBCLASS<BR></EM>This specifies the name of the Java class 
which will be used as your&nbsp;JDBC or ODBC database driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you 
are using a System ODBC data&nbsp;source, this entry will typically be 
"sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver".&nbsp;&nbsp;By default, however, the CoffeeMud 
"fakedb" package is&nbsp;installed.&nbsp; The driver name for this class is 
"com.planet_ink.fakedb.Driver".&nbsp; See the next section on "The CoffeeMud 
Database" for more information.<BR><BR><EM>DBSERVICE</EM> <BR>This is the name 
of the JDBC or ODBC Service as defined by your local operating system.&nbsp; It 
typically denotes the name of the ODBC service, or the name of the database in 
other instances.&nbsp; For a System&nbsp;ODBC service, this value will typically 
look like "jdbc:odbc:SystemServiceName".&nbsp; By default, however, the fakedb 
package is used.&nbsp; The format of the service name for fakedb is 
"jdbc:fakedb:DataPath".&nbsp; Where DataPath is a local drive path containing 
the "fakedb.schema" file, where your flat data files will be created.&nbsp; See 
the section on "The CoffeeMud Database" for more information.<BR><BR><EM>DBUSER, 
DBPASS <BR></EM>This specifies the name and password which may or may not be 
required to log into your ODBC service, or database.&nbsp; Not required for 
fakedb, and thus blank by default.</P>
<P align=left><EM>DBCONNECTIONS<BR></EM>This &nbsp;is the number of independent connections to 
make to the database through your JDBC/ODBC driver.&nbsp; 1 or 2 is 
plenty.&nbsp; CoffeeMud is not&nbsp;especially database intensive.
<P align=left><EM>* In Addition to the 
above, you will find other numerous flags and settings which allow you to better 
customize your CoffeeMud.&nbsp; Make sure you look through your coffeemud.ini 
file for more information on these. If you wish to customize some of 
the CoffeeMud game settings, it is highly recommended that you read through 
the INI file as if it were just another Installation Guide.</EM>&nbsp;&nbsp;      
             
      
<P>
<IMG src="images/db.jpg">
<P><STRONG><FONT size=5>The CoffeeMud Database:</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left>CoffeeMud requires a database for 
operation.&nbsp; A database is simply the place where all the rooms, items, 
monsters, players, pets, and other information is stored on the computer.&nbsp; 
Without the database, you would have to start all over from scratch every time 
you booted the MUD Server.&nbsp; And we all know that would be bad.</P>
<P align=left>By default, CoffeeMud uses a custom JDBC flat-file database called 
"fakedb".&nbsp; FakeDB stores its data into text formatted files inside the 
"data" directory of your CoffeeMud package.&nbsp; FakeDB is rather slow, and 
hardly a powerful or professional database system, but it is quite sufficient 
for CoffeeMud, and performs well the small tasks it was designed for.&nbsp; </P>
<P align=left>For the more adventurous, CoffeeMud supports any JDBC or ODBC compliant 
database system.&nbsp; This includes such systems as Microsoft Access, Microsoft 
SQL Server, PostGRE SQL, MySQL, Oracle, and others.&nbsp; While this document 
cannot cover the step by step installation instructions for each of these 
systems, it can be pointed out that everything you need has been provided.&nbsp; 
Inside the "guides/database/" directory of your CoffeeMud package, 
you will find four files: "coffeemuddb.sql", "coffeemuddb2.sql", "coffeemuddbaccess.sql", "coffeemuddbmysql.sql", 
and "fakedb.schema".&nbsp; The first&nbsp;four are SQL Scripts which can be used to create 
the necessary tables in Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, Access, and some of 
the others.&nbsp; The last is a copy of the same fakedb file from your "data" 
directory, in case it becomes corrupted.&nbsp; Although the manner in which the 
SQL Scripts are used may differ from system to system, they cannot all be 
covered here.&nbsp; Some of the scripts may need to be changed slightly to work 
with some systems.&nbsp; Some systems will require each SQL Statement be issued 
independently instead of as part of a larger script.&nbsp; Please consult your 
database documentation for more information on this.</P>
<P align=left>            
            
            
      In order to 
use your database with CoffeeMud, as specified in the section on Settings, you 
must provide CoffeeMud with a JDBC compliant Driver class.&nbsp; In many cases, you 
will be creating a System ODBC Data Source.&nbsp; When this is the case, 
the driver "sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver" may be used to access the database.&nbsp;</P>
<P align=left>Some systems, however, such as MySQL, and Microsoft SQL Server 
2000, have native JDBC Drivers which may be used instead of the general ODBC 
Driver.&nbsp; These native JDBC Drivers tend to be far superior to their ODBC 
counterparts, and are highly recommended.</P>
<P align=left>The care and feeding of the tables used by CoffeeMud should be 
very low.&nbsp; The database will grow along with the areas created, and along 
with the number of players which join your MUD.&nbsp; All of this growth can be 
managed, however, within CoffeeMud itself, by your Archon administrative 
user.&nbsp; You should not need to, nor should you attempt to affect individual 
rows in your database for any reason.</P>
<P align=left><EM>Installing and using Microsoft Access with CoffeeMud 
on a Windows machine</EM></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>1.</STRONG> Open up Microsoft Access and select to create 
a Blank Access Database.&nbsp; Give the database a name and save it on your hard

<P align=left><STRONG>2.</STRONG> Under Objects, select the Queries section and 
select Create Query in Design View.&nbsp; When the dialog box appears, click the 
close button.</P>
<P align=left><STRONG>3.</STRONG> Now right click on the large grey area and 
select "SQL View" from the context Menu.</P>
<P align=left><STRONG>4.</STRONG> Inside your CoffeeMud/guides/database folder, 
open up the coffeemuddbaccess.sql file using Notepad.&nbsp; You will see that the 
file contains numerous blocks of sql text.&nbsp; Each block begins with CREATE 
TABLE, and ends with a semicolon ); </P>
<P align=left><STRONG>5.</STRONG> Select the first block of text in your sql 
file, from the first CREATE TABLE line down through the ); line, and select Copy 
from Notepad.&nbsp; Paste this block into the Select Query area in Microsoft 
Access.&nbsp; Paste it over any other text that may be in there.</P>
<P align=left><STRONG>6.</STRONG> Press the "!" symbol at the top to execute the 
block of sql script.</P>
<P align=left><STRONG>7.</STRONG> Repeat steps 5 and 6 for the remaining CREATE

the next page, click on the download link for "Source and Binaries (zip)" ( be 
SURE to get the&nbsp;ZIP file, not the (tar.gz)!) The file name should be 
"mysql-connector-java-3.0.7-stable.zip". Again, save this file to&nbsp;your temp 
folder as well.</P>
<P align=left><STRONG>3. </STRONG>  Locate the mysql-4.0.1.2-win.zip file you downloaded and 
unzip it ( if you dont know how to do that..I dont think running a mud 
should&nbsp;be on your list of priorities...) and run the setup.exe file there. 
Just hit Next<BR>for all the prompts, and it should install to c:\mysql by 
default.<BR><BR><STRONG>4. </STRONG>  Go to your coffeemud folder, open the guides\database 
folder, and you will see a file called "coffeemuddbmysql.sql". Open that 
file&nbsp;with a text editor or notepad etc... (you might want to make a backup 
copy<BR>first...) Now, add the following:<BR><BR><FONT face="Courier New"># 
Connection: SQL<BR># Host: localhost<BR># Saved: 2003-04-01 00:29:14<BR>#<BR># 
Connection: SQL<BR># Host: localhost<BR># Saved: 2003-04-01 00:27:39<BR>#<BR>use 
coffeemud&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&lt;----ADD THIS LINE!<BR>CREATE TABLE CMCHAB (<BR>CMUSERID char (50) NULL 
,<BR>CMABID char (50) NULL ,<BR>CMABPF int NULL ,<BR>CMABTX text 
NULL<BR></FONT>etc..<BR>etc..<BR><BR>Now copy the edited coffeemuddbmysql.sql to 
your c:\mysql\bin folder.<BR><BR><STRONG>5. </STRONG>  Now, open a DOS window (Start &gt; Run 
&gt; type "command" and hit enter) and type cd c:\mysql\bin and hit Enter. Your 
prompt should now be c:\mysql\bin&gt; then type "mysqld" (notice the d on the 
end..?). After&nbsp; a few moments, it should start up the mysql server. You 
wont get a new window or icon or anything, I check it by <BR>doing CTRL-ALT-DEL 
and see if Mysqld is listed in the Close Program Window. If it's there, you're 
in business, and MySQL is running in the background. You should now be back to 
the c:\mysql\bin&gt; prompt. Type "mysql" and enter. You&nbsp;should get a 
Welcome to the MySQL monitor etc. etc. etc.. and now the prompt should simply 
say "mysql&gt;" . Now type "create database coffeemud;" (please note the 
semi-colon";"!!!) and hit enter. You should get "Query OK, 1 row affected 
&lt;0.11sec)" or something like that... then type "\q" and that should quit you 
out of the monitor.<BR><BR><STRONG>6. </STRONG>  Now that your out of the monitor, you should 
be back to the c:\mysql\bin&gt; prompt. Now type "mysql &lt; 
coffeemuddbmysql.sql"&nbsp; (without the quotes of course) and hit enter... 
again, after a moment or 2, it SHOULD<BR>return you to the c:\mysql\bin&gt; 
prompt. Go ahead and close that window now. In theory, you should now have mysql 
running and a coffeemud database&nbsp;all set for it to access.<BR><BR><STRONG>7. 
</STRONG>  
Now go to your coffeemud folder and open your coffeemud.ini file in notepad or 
some text editor, and look for the section that says:<BR><FONT 
face="Courier New">DBCLASS=com.planet_ink.fakedb.Driver<BR>DBSERVICE=jdbc:fakedb:data<BR>DBUSER=<BR>DBPASS=<BR>DBCONNECTIONS=2<BR></FONT><BR>and 
change it to:<BR><BR><FONT 
face="Courier New">DBCLASS=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver<BR>DBSERVICE=jdbc:mysql://localhost/coffeemud<BR>DBUSER=<BR>DBPASS=<BR>DBCONNECTIONS=4<BR></FONT><BR><STRONG>8. </STRONG> 
 Go back to the other file you downloaded in STEP 2, 
mysql-connector-java-3.0.7-stable.zip, and now extract that into a temp folder. 
Inside, there should be a "mysql-connector-java-3.0.7-stable" folder and inside 
that, a "com" folder, and inside THAT, a "mysql" folder. Copy the mysql folder 
over into your c:\coffeemud\com folder. So now inside c:\coffeemud\com, ther 
should be 2 folders, one called <FONT face="Courier New">mysql</FONT>, and one 
called <FONT face="Courier New">planet_ink</FONT>.</P>
<P align=left><STRONG>9. </STRONG>  Now, with mysqld still running in the background, just 
launch the mud.bat AS IT IS to start the mud..( I didnt have to make ANY changes 
in there for this to work, hopefully the same for you...)<BR></P>
<P><EM>Installing and using MySQL with CoffeeMud on a UN*X 
or Linux machine</EM></P>
<P><STRONG>1.</STRONG> Download and install mysql from <A 
href="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/index.html">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/index.html</A>. 
Make sure mysqld is being run at boot time, and not by the root user. </P>
<P><STRONG>2.</STRONG>&nbsp;Download and install the mysql jdbc api from <A 
href="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-jdbc-stable.html">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-jdbc-stable.html</A>.&nbsp;Extract 
the .tar.gz file to a temporary directory.&nbsp;Then copy the extracted 
/com/mysql/ directory (not just its contents) into /CoffeeMUD/com/.</P>
<P><STRONG>3.</STRONG> Create a coffeemud database from the shell as root type, 
"mysqladmin create coffeemud" (in this example we name the db 
coffeemud).&nbsp;If you screw up, or need to delete the new db for some reason, 
you can always do a "mysqladmin drop coffeemud". </P>
<P><STRONG>4.</STRONG> Create a user for the new database (user in this example 
is called coffee).&nbsp; As root, type "mysql" into the shell. Now enter: GRANT 
ALL ON coffeemud.* TO coffee@localhost IDENTIFIED BY "password";&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Enter a password for the user inside the quotes.&nbsp;Now type, "quit". </P>
<P><STRONG>5.</STRONG> Edit the file CoffeeMUD/guides/coffeemuddbmysql.sql like 
so:&nbsp;at line 9 insert "use coffeemud" (assuming the new db is called 
coffeemud). Then save the changes. </P>
<P><STRONG>6.</STRONG> Run the SQL file as follows:&nbsp;from the shell type, 
"mysql &lt; coffeemuddbmysql.sql" </P>
<P><STRONG>7.</STRONG> Edit the following settings in CoffeeMUD/coffeemud.ini: 
<BR>DBCLASS=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver <BR>DBSERVICE=jdbc:mysql://localhost/coffeemud 
<BR>DBUSER=coffee <BR>DBPASS=password <BR>DBCONNECTIONS=4 </P>
<P>(no quotes on the password here)<BR>Save your changes and fire up 
CoffeeMud!</P>
