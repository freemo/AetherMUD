			</p><pre>Your alignment represents your moral fiber, with Good representing selfless<br />benevolence, Evil representing selfish maliciousness, and Neutral representing the<br />balance of the two. <br /><br />In combat, the amount of experience you receive from the vanquishing of a foe<br />depends partially on your alignment versus that of the creature you have killed. <br />In general, if you are Good and you kill a Good creature, or Evil and kill an Evil<br />creature, or Neutral and kill a Neutral creature, you receive NO experience.  The<br />amount of experience can vary depending upon how close to perfect Goodness, perfect<br />Evil, or pure Neutrality you are.  In addition to receiving no experience for<br />violating this rule, you will find your characters alignment slowly changing with<br />each repeat offense. <br /><br />For some classes, alignment can have other affects.  Paladins must always be<br />good, and will find that their spellcasting ability disappears with their goodness.<br /> Clerics may be good or evil, but their spell choices can profoundly impact their<br />alignment.  A Good Cleric or Paladin who casts malicious spells will soon find<br />themselves becoming evil.  Evil Clerics can suffer the same fate for using<br />benevolent spells.</pre>

So skilled are they in the alteration of the universe that<br />they gain all known alteration spells, including some which only the alterer may<br />gain.<br /><br />The Alterer suffers from a lack of access to the Evocation school of magic, the<br />long duration and heavy impact of their spells plus the general usefulness of their<br />school makes them a good choice for all mages.

He is<br />an accumulator of wands and scrolls; making good use of his limited knowledge to<br />create, improve, and most especially use these items to his devious ends. <br />Arcanists are also just knowledgable enough to learn spells simply by observing<br />their usage, although, lacking any innate power, he forgets them as soon as they<br />are used.</pre>

To start an auction, the player enters AUCTION UP plus the name of the<br />item, and an optional starting bid.  If there is no other auction going on at the<br />time, the auction will begin.  Auctions last for a silent 5 minutes, plus 1 minute<br />for each going once/twice/sold.  If no bids have been received after the first 3<br />minutes, the item will proceed directly to the going once/twice/sold period. The<br />person putting on the auction may, at any time, close the auction without penalty<br />by entering "auction close", or communicate on the auction channel (to give a<br />better item description perhaps) using "auction channel [message]".<br /><br />To place a bid on an auction that is ongoing, a player need only enter "auction<br />bid [amount]".  Where amount is the maximum amount the player will pay for the<br />item.  A proxy bidding system is in place for all auctions.  The current bid on the<br />item will always be less than or equal to the bid of the high bidder, and at least<br />1 gold more than the bid of the previous high bidder.  This means that, if the<br />current bid on an item is 5, and a player bids 10, the new bid will become 6 (one<br />more than the previous high bid).  If another player then bids 20, the new bid will<br />become 11.<br /><br />Players can also get information on a live auction while it is going on by<br />entering AUCTION INFO or AUCTION LIST.<br /><br />When an auction ends, the system will attempt to automatically complete the<br />transaction for both the bidder and the auctioneer.  The proper money will be<br />transferred (in converted notes) from the high bidder to the auctioneer.  The item<br />up for auction will be automatically transferred from the auctioneer to the high<br />bidder.  The auction house may take a cut both when then auction is placed up, and<br />on the final price. <br /><br />See also help on AUCTIONS</pre>

			<a name="AUCTIONS"><b>AUCTIONS</b></a>
			<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			</p><pre>Auctions are a system whereby players can buy and sell items from each other<br />using an open bidding system.  In this system, a bidder places a bid which<br />represents the most they will pay for the item.  However, a bidder must only end up<br />paying an amount equal to the most anyone ELSE would also pay, so long as it is<br />less than their own maximum bid. <br /><br />This game supports two kinds of auctions.  One is a multi-game-day auction,<br />which requires that you find an auctioneer mob and use commmands like BUY, SELL,<br />VIEW, and BID. The game also supports a live auction system, which is managed using<br />the AUCTION command.  Only one such live auction is allowed at any one time.  See<br />help on the above commands for more information.</pre>

It is in the<br />company of other, more powerful classes, that the bard will flourish. And because<br />of the unique nature of his magic, and how his skills will always affect groups,<br />that groups will always want to have a bard along.<br /><br />Bards are as weak as thieves in combat, and lack their general sneakiness, so<br />in the company of others must the bard find his path to greatness, filling any<br />skill gaps in almost any group with the appropriate magic or ability.<br /></pre>

He also has<br />numerous ways of enhancing his own innate fighting ability through magical chants,<br />making him formidable even when adventuring without animal companions.</pre>

			</p><pre>Clans are a group of players banded together for some common purpose, or due to<br />common lineage or fellowship.  Clans are created using the CLANCREATE command, and<br />listed using CLANLIST.  Members apply to clans using CLANAPPLY, and are either<br />accepted by the clan using CLANACCEPT or rejected using CLANREJECT, after listing<br />the applicants names using CLANDETAILS. Bosses can set up autorejecting<br />qualifications to the clan using CLANQUAL. Once accepted, members can be removed<br />using CLANEXILE or promoted to other offices using CLANASSIGN.  Members can leave<br />on their own using CLANNRESIGN. Offices like Treasurers can deal with special Clan<br />bankers and postmen on their Clans behalf.  Members can cast "Clan Donate" to their<br />clans after the boss has used CLANDONATESET to set a donation room for their clan. <br />Members can share their experience points with the clan if the bosses have set up<br />an experience tax rate using CLANTAX. Members also have access to the spell "Clan<br />Home" which they can use to recall to the room set by the boss using CLANHOMESET.<br />Clan activity is very important.  If the minimum number of members is not<br />maintained, then pending or inactive clans may be deleted by the system. Once there<br />are several active clans, the bosses may use CLANDECLARE to declare relations<br />between their clan and others.  The bosses may also want to use CLANPREMISE to<br />describe their clan.<br /><br />There are four different types of clans: GANG, GUILD, UNION, and FELLOWSHIP. <br />See the HELP entry for each of these clan types for more information.</pre>

However, should the cleric wish to show true<br />devotion, he can gain levels in specialist classes which may or may not be<br />available to him, depending on his disposition. These classes include: Templar,<br />Shaman, Doomsayer, Necromancer, Missionary, Purist, Healer, or Oracle.<br /><br />How to play: The first, last, and greatest strength of the good Cleric is in<br />his ability to heal, just as the ability to harm aids the evil Cleric.  A Cleric is<br />unique in his ability to flourish either alone or in groups, being moderately<br />skilled in combat, and having the healing ability to last a long time in a tough<br />fight.  Clerics are highly desired for groups, however, as the lead fighter in the<br />group will want the Cleric's healing touch in battle.<br /><br />The only weakness of the Cleric is offensively, which the evil Cleric will make<br />up for with harmful magic, and the good Cleric will compensate for with healing<br />spells to last out the battle.  With a balanced approach, the Cleric can gain<br />experience with the efficiency of a fighter.<br /></pre>

			<a name="CONQUEST"><b>CONQUEST</b></a>
			<br />

			<br />
			</p><pre>One or more areas in the realm may be designated as conquerable by clans. <br /><br />To conquer an area, or even to discover if an area CAN be conquered, the clan<br />must use the Clan Crafting skill to construct a clan Flag.  The Flag must then be<br />dropped into any room in the area.  Doing so will tell you if the area is<br />conquerable, who controls it if anyone, how many CONTROL POINTS are required to<br />control the area, and how many control points any warring clans may presently have<br />in the area.  An area not currently controlled by any clan may freely be conquered.<br /> An area already controlled by a clan may only be conquered by a rival clan if that<br />clan has properly declared War.<br /><br />The clan Flag is the most important item in Conquest.  The Flag must be on the<br />ground in order for any clan to score control points in an area, or to even<br />maintain control once the area has been conquered.  If there is not at least one<br />Flag on the ground, a conquered area will revert to neutral status.  Luckily, any<br />resident citizens in the same room as a conquerer's flag will tend to guard the<br />flag from thieves.  Also, Flags can only be removed by a member of the clan whose<br />flag it is, or by a rival clan after they have completely conquered and control the<br />area.<br /><br />Once a flag has been laid down, the clan whose flag it is may LOOK at the flag<br />at any time to see the status of their conquest; i.e. the number of control points<br />they have scored, and how many they must score to complete the conquest.  A control<br />point is scored whenever a resident intelligent mob of that area is killed, forced<br />(via charm or other methods) to follow a member of the conquering clan, </pre>

For this reason, the Delver is better able to fit into groups who wish<br />to adventure in the mountains and the underground, and can be a valuable leader<br />when its time to enter the deep dark.</pre>

These sub-classes include: Delver,<br />Beastmaster, Gaian, and SkyWatcher.<br /><br />How to play: The druid is the most complex class to play.  Most of his magic<br />requires the assistance of numerous spells to bear fruit, but the benefits make the<br />complexity well worth it.  The druid is also best fit for travelling with animal<br />armies of his own creation.  In groups, the druid can assist with some extra fire<br />power at high levels.  For the most part though, it is alone that the druid will<br />flourish, forming his own animal groups to make up for his weakness in combat.<br /><br />Although weak in melee combat, due to equipment and skill limitations, the<br />druid is capable of marshaling all the powers of animals and plants to aid in the<br />vanquishing of foes for experience.  At higher levels, as the powers of weather<br />come into play, the Druid will find their magical prowess unequaled by any other<br />class.</pre>

			</p><pre>Fighters are brutish weapon masters, skilled in the art of killing.  They may<br />specialize in any weapon type, and learn numerous new fighting techniques as they<br />advance in level.  Fighters receive more hit points and attack bonuses per level<br />than any other class, and are invaluable in a close melee.<br /><br />Fighter is the starting point for numerous sub-classes which the player may<br />choose to gain levels in at any time.  These sub-classes include: Monk, Ranger,<br />Paladin, and Barbarian.<br /><br />How to play: The fighters strength is in his domination of pure combat. When<br />playing alone, a fighter is fully capable of gaining the necessary experience. <br />However, the fighter may choose to lead a group to gain an even greater advantage. <br />As the tank (primary melee combatant) in a group, the fighter will give the group<br />the benefit of his superior armor and fighting skill, while benefitting from the<br />healing spells of a cleric, or the magical aids of a mage.<br /><br />The fighters greatest weakness is his inability to move secretly, or get into<br />or out of tricky spots.  For this reason, the fighter outside of a group should<br />steer towards simple combat areas, and be content only with the treasures obtains<br />from his kills.<br /></pre>

The "front line" is considered row 0. The lead<br />player must always be on a row ahead or on the same row as his followers. When<br />formations are used in conjunction with AUTOMELEE, it can effectively aid archers<br />and mages with ranged spells in battle.  The range of the group members in<br />formation, with respect to enemies, is always relative to the initial range of the<br />lead player in combat.  That is to say, if a group member is set to be at row #1,<br />and the leader uses a bow to start off at range 3, then that group member will be<br />at row #4 instead (1 off from the leaders position).  <br />Any member of a group can enter the FORMATION command without parameters to<br />view the current marching order.

The gaian has a very special relationship with the plants and<br />trees, having special abilities to make almost any location he steps into a<br />sanctuary for his leafed friends.  So in tune with green things is the gaian that<br />sunlight can actually give his green tinted skin additional powers, though the<br />darkness will slightly weaken his chanting stamina.  The gaian can also call on the<br />plants and trees around him to aid in him combat, to hide him from foes, or even to<br />provide him with the things one would normally have to seek civilization for.  <br /><br />How to play: The Gaian, so long as he stays around green plants, is a<br />formidable foe to all enemies of nature.  The gaian can call all aspects of the<br />plants to his aid, and can always find sanctuary in the green plants during times<br />of trouble.  The gaian is weak in native combat abilities, like the other druids,<br />but can make up for it with creative pre-casting, and good use of the power of<br />nature during combat.</pre>

The Healer also gets a few special prayers<br />known only to the Healer, including the great Aura of Healing at 30th level. <br /><br />How to play: More than any other cleric, the Healer is a most desirable group<br />member.  There is no ailment, no weakness, no problem almost that the Healer can<br />not cure through the power of his god.  In the heat of battle, or in the periods in<br />between, the Healer is a valued friend to those who take the brunt of battle.  The<br />Healer can also try it alone if he likes, if he is willing to use patience and<br />plenty of cure spells to outlast his opponents.</pre>

While<br />weak in hit points and in fighting skill, their spells are the most widely prized<br />and powerful of all the classes.  They may not wear any metal or leather armors, or<br />use most weapons.  However, the sting of their magic missiles and the armor of<br />magic they wear makes up for any loss.<br /><br />Mage is the basis for numerous sub-classes which the player may choose to gain<br />levels in at any time.  These sub-classes include: Abjurer, Alterer, Conjurer,<br />Diviner, Enchanter, Evoker, Illusionist, Transmuter, and Wizard.<br /><br />How to play: Mages are among the most versatile of classes, being able to make<br />spell choices which carve out the path the Mage would like to take.  For the loner<br />Mage, the emphasis on offensive magic will make him a powerful opponent in battle. <br />In groups, the mage may focus on protective magic to make him a more desirable<br />companion.  And even the playful mage may focus on the role-playing magic to make<br />his mudding as fun as possible!<br /><br />The mage is almost useless in weapon combat.  The mage must be smart and<br />creative to use his spells to give him the edge.  But the versatility of the mage<br />gives him the ability to do just that, using magic and guile to trick monsters to<br />their death, granting experience for the mage.<br /></pre>

			<br />
			</p><pre>The Minstrel is the master of instruments and musical tools.  So capable is a<br />minstrel in this art that he or she is able to draw forth magical and wonderous<br />powers from the instruments played.  The Minstrel is able to craft and draw unique<br />powers from any of dozens of different musical instruments, with the only drawback<br />being how the chosen instrument impacts fighting or speaking ability while it is<br />being played.<br /><br />How to play: The Minstrel is as social of a bard as the others, but due to his<br />many hours of lonely practice, the Minstrel also has an almost arcane like ability<br />to use instrumental magic for more solitary or unique benefits than the simple Bard<br />or Dancer.  In the end, the Minstrel may become an orchestra of power unto himself,<br />capable of bringing tremendous benefit and joy to his group, or terrible<br />retribution to his foes.  Therefore, if a player is looking for a bard to play when<br />groups are not available, this is the one to pick.</pre>

			</p><pre>Missionaries are the crusading adventurers for the gods, exploring and<br />spreading the good word of their deity far and wide.  So energetic and mobile are<br />the Missionaries that they seem like the wind, and in fact gain many powers of wind<br />and electricity.  The Missionary is a neutral aligned class. <br /><br />How to play: Although Missionaries can flourish with other missionaries, they<br />do their best work alone, bringing the word of their god, as well as his wrath when<br />necessary, to the unwashed masses.  Missionaries will sometimes be asked to join<br />groups so as to deliver some of that "olde-tyme neutral punch", and can even be<br />useful to them if he strikes a careful balance with the good and evil prayers he<br />qualifies for.</pre>

			<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			</p><pre>Monks are the agile and graceful masters of their own bodies.  Combining quick<br />reflexes with intense study of the martial arts makes them a powerful and<br />intimidating opponent.  Although Monks may use weapons, most of their power and<br />unique ability comes when they are completely unarmed.  And since they depend so<br />heavily on their agility, they will find themselves wearing only light cloth<br />armors.<br /><br />How to play: Either alone or in groups, the Monk is a dizzying class to play.<br />Capable of more pure attacks than any other class, and loaded down with dozens of<br />Monk-specific physical feats makes the Monk almost mage-like in complexity.  In<br />fact, the player who loathes worrying about staying up-to-date on equipment, but<br />who enjoys the pure fight may be especially attracted to Monk.<br /><br />Like all fighters, the Monk will gain experience principally through the<br />vanquishing of foes.  Although the armor restriction can seem daunting, the Monks<br />extra dexterity bonus to armor, and the wide variety of attacks and defences makes<br />them every bit as powerful (if not much more) than the other fighter classes.<br /></pre>

The Necromancer is an evil aligned<br />class, meaning that he will always fumble on good prayers, and does not qualify for<br />good prayers.  However, the Necromancer can use many dangerous edged weapons, any<br />kind of armor, and gets numerous special prayers known only to the Necromancer,<br />such as the ability to animate all kinds of wicked undead, even at low levels.<br />Eventually, the Necromancer may even become a Lich himself! <br /><br />How to play: Unlike most clerics, the Necromancer is not a good group player.<br />He does best alone with the friends he "makes" out of the dearly departed. The<br />necromancer is hated in towns, and may even be arrested if he brings his undead<br />"friends" to town for a visit.  If the Necromancer keeps his charisma high, he can<br />lead a truely formidable army before which all others will surely tremble.  </pre>

Also, the Ranger<br />will have to be careful to maintain a neutral alignment in order for the druidic<br />chants to become useful.

By accumulating the wealth of others, the<br />thief can stay comfortably equipped with the latest and best money can buy. When<br />playing alone, the thief thrives as the only class able to get into and out of any<br />secret place without stirring up unnecessary trouble.  Although not generally<br />appreciated in groups, a group benefits from these skills, as well as the thiefs<br />unique ability to deliver enormous amounts of backstab damage.<br /><br />The thief is only moderately skilled at combat, but can make up for it by using<br />his wealth to obtain favors, good equipment, and the necessary potions and scrolls<br />necessary to survive the experience gaining battles.<br /></font></font></pre>

			</font></font></p><pre><font color="CYAN"><font color="CYAN">Wizards are great specialist scholar mages who have mastered the study (but not<br />the art) of arcane magic.  They are capable of memorizing and casting any basic<br />arcane spell, but their lack of mastery means they forget the spell as soon as it<br />is cast.  This means that the wizard is constantly engaged in study, carrying<br />around and/or creating numerous arcane scrolls to serve as the source for their<br />next bit of magic.  Since they don't specialize or train in particular arcane<br />spells, but can learn any spell, the Wizard is the most versitile Mage, though not<br />necessarily the easiest to engage in combat with. <br /><br />The Wizards manner of study requires that he expend his spell-casting mana when<br />he learns or memorizes a spell, but this mana is released for use after the spell<br />is cast.  Wizards can be invaluable as group members, and as clan members, but will<br />struggle adventuring alone. A wizards lack of need to expend training time on<br />individual spells means he can work on other aspects of himself, including stats or<br />expertises, making the Wizard very powerful in the long run.</font></font></pre>
