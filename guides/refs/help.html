The current bid on the item<BR>will always be less than or equal to the bid of the high bidder, and at least 1<BR>gold more than the bid of the previous high bidder.  This means that, if the<BR>current bid on an item is 5, and a player bids 10, the new bid will become 6 (one<BR>more than the previous high bid).  If another player then bids 20, the new bid will<BR>become 11.<BR><BR>When an auction ends, the system will attempt to automatically complete the<BR>transaction for both the bidder and the auctioneer.  The proper money will be<BR>transferred (in converted notes) from the high bidder to the auctioneer.  The item<BR>up for auction will be automatically transferred from the auctioneer to the high<BR>bidder.</PRE>

These sub-classes include the Charlatan, Prancer, Minstrel,<BR>and the Jester.<BR><BR>How to play: The great strength of the bard is in his wide assortment of<BR>skills, and in his powerful songs.  The bard may try his hand as the lonesome<BR>travellor, but will find his skills still put him behind his peers.  It is in the<BR>company of other, more powerful classes, that the bard will flourish. And because<BR>of the unique nature of his magic, and how his skills will always affect groups,<BR>that groups will always want to have a bard along.<BR><BR>Bards are as weak as thieves in combat, and lack their general sneakiness, so<BR>in the company of others must the bard find his path to greatness, filling any<BR>skill gaps in almost any group with the appropriate magic or ability.&lt;BR&gt;</PRE>

If there is not at least one<BR>Flag on the ground, a conquered area will revert to neutral status.  Luckily, any<BR>resident citizens in the same room as a conquerer's flag will tend to guard the<BR>flag from thieves.  Also, Flags can only be removed by a member of the clan whose<BR>flag it is, or by a rival clan who has properly declared War.<BR><BR>Once a flag has been laid down, the clan whose flag it is may LOOK at the flag<BR>at any time to see the status of their conquest; i.e. the number of control points<BR>they have scored, and how many they must score to complete the conquest.  A control<BR>point is scored whenever a resident mob of that area is killed, or forced (via<BR>charm or other methods) to follow a member of the conquering clan. Control points<BR>awarded are equal to the level of the mob killed or charmed. Control points will<BR>also fade over time, to reflect a restoration of order in the area.<BR><BR>If an area is already under the control of a clan, the resident mobs will<BR>resist invasion by rivals.  Once an area is conquered, however, all resident mobs<BR>will instantly disavow any previous controlling clan, drop any clan items they may<BR>be carrying, and swear allegiance to the conquering clan.  At this point, any clan<BR>members who are designated as having conquerers privileges may ORDER any member of<BR>the area to do anything they like.  Control points become irrelevant to the<BR>conquerers once control is established.<BR><BR>Clan members are unable to gain any experience points inside their own<BR>conquered areas.  However, anyone else gaining experience in a clan controlled area<BR>automatically pays the clans tax on their experience gain. This makes controlling a<BR>large number of areas very lucrative for clans.<BR><BR>A conquered area benefits greatly from items created using Clan Crafting. <BR>These items can be crafted by a designated Enchanter, given sufficient materials<BR>and clan experience.  Clan items can be captured for additional clan experience by<BR>rival clans who have properly declared war. The types and functions of clan items<BR>include:<BR><BR>Book of the Laws - These must be constructed inside the area for which the book<BR>is intended.  It will allow a properly privileged clan member to read and modify<BR>numerous aspects of law and order in the area, including the location of jails, the<BR>types of laws, and the duration of punishments. A Law Book must be read by clan<BR>member authorized to change law before the Guardbanner and Gavel below will begin<BR>working.<BR><BR>Guardbanner - These can be given to mobs in a conquered area to designate them<BR>as deputys of the area, who are authorized to enforce laws and arrest lawbreakers.<BR><BR>Judges Gavel - This can be given to a mob in a conquered area to designate him<BR>as the judge of the area, authorizing him to deal out punishments like parole, jail<BR>time, or death.<BR><BR>Donation List - This item should be placed inside the official Donation Room<BR>for a clan.  If this is done, the list will automatically grow to include every<BR>single addition and removal.<BR><BR>Pamphlet - These can be given to mobs conquered by RIVAL clans to make them<BR>disloyal to the conquering clan. Pamphlets will have a tendency to spread over<BR>time. Pamphlet holders will also drop any rival clan items they have, which hurts<BR>control.<BR><BR>Shop Apron - These can be given to mobs conquered by your clan, or to mobs<BR>permanently stationed at your clan home.  They turn the mob into a shopkeeper, who<BR>will sell things in their shop inventory, and buy things as their coinage allows. <BR>They can be GIVEN things to sell by clan members in proper authority over them. <BR>They will not deal with clans with whom your clan is hostile or at war.<BR><BR>Membership Card - These can be given to mobs conquered by your clan to make<BR>them utterly loyal to your clan.  Mobs with membership cards will never accept<BR>Pamphlets, and will take them away if they are offered any.<BR><BR>Gathering items - Items such as the Miners Pick and Lumberjacks Saw can be<BR>given to mobs to make them work for the clan, performing the Common skill<BR>associated with the item.  If the mobs with these items are also Mobile, they may<BR>also carry their resources to other mobs in the same area who need their resources<BR>in order to use their Crafting items.  Firebuilders are especially good at this<BR>task, as they will carry wood they find to smiths and light the fires that the<BR>smiths need to shape the metals.<BR><BR>Crafting items - Items such as the Tailors Needle and Potters Wheel can be<BR>given to mobs to make them craft items for the clan, performing the Common skill<BR>associated with the item.  These mobs can be given example items to use as<BR>templates for what they will attempt to make, or they can be given nothing to make<BR>them craft items at random.  For the skill to work, the mob must not have anything<BR>in its inventory to confuse the skill, such as a Blacksmith item holder carrying<BR>some smurfberries.  Also, the holder must have the correct resource and sufficient<BR>quantity in the room to work from, although, they may receive assistance gaining<BR>the resources they need from mobs with Gathering Items.<BR><BR>Executioners Scales - This item makes the mob a tenacious attacker of evil<BR>creatures and thieves.<BR><BR>Assassins Eye - This item makes the mob a tenacious attacker of good creatures<BR>and paladins.<BR><BR>Scavengers Sticker - This item makes the mob a scavenger, picking anything up<BR>they find on the ground.<BR><BR>Tax Collectors Clipboard - This item makes the mob a collector of tax money<BR>from anyone who is not also a member of their clan.<BR><BR>See also Clan Crafting.</PRE>

However, the sting of their magic missiles and the armor of<BR>magic they wear makes up for any loss.<BR><BR>Mage is the basis for numerous sub-classes which the player may choose to gain<BR>levels in at any time.  These sub-classes include: Abjurer, Alterer, Conjurer,<BR>Diviner, Enchanter, Evoker, Illusionist, and Transmuter.<BR><BR>How to play: Mages are easily the most versatile of classes, being able to make<BR>spell choices which carve out the path the Mage would like to take.  For the loner<BR>Mage, the emphasis on offensive magic will make him a powerful opponent in battle. <BR>In groups, the mage may focus on protective magic to make him a more desirable<BR>companion.

The Minstrel is able to craft and draw unique<BR>powers from any of dozens of different musical instruments, with the only drawback<BR>being how the chosen instrument impacts fighting or speaking ability while it is<BR>being played.<BR><BR>How to play: The Minstrel is as social of a bard as the others, but due to his<BR>many hours of lonely practice, the Minstrel also has an almost arcane like ability<BR>to use instrumental magic for more solitary or unique benefits than the simple Bard<BR>or Prancer.  In the end, the Minstrel may become an orchestra of power unto<BR>himself, capable of bringing tremendous benefit and joy to his group, or terrible<BR>retribution to his foes.
