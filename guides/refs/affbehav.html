In the first<BR>example every 10-20 ticks, there is a 25% chance that the object with this property<BR>will select one of the emotes randomly and perform it for all those in the same<BR>room who can see it.

If the parameter is empty, the mob<BR>will be able to teach all abilities.  If the parameter contains the name of a<BR>character class, the mob will only teach abilities of that class. *Any* class may<BR>always practice with a MOBTeacher, but the mob may only teach those abilities for<BR>the character class the parameters describe.  The classes listed by mob teacher are<BR>NOT base classes.  To have a teacher able to teach skills from an entire base<BR>class, all sub-classes must be listed. <BR>Percentages may be included inside the parameters as well.  The percentage will<BR>always apply only to the character classes or spells listed after the percentage,<BR>not before.  Encountering another percentage entry will override the previous.  A<BR>percentage will dictate the chance that a given spell will be known by the teacher,<BR>or the chance that a particular spell in a given character class will be known. <BR>Two flags can also modify your list.  The NOCOMMON flag prevents the teacher<BR>from teaching common skills, even if they would normally be on his list.  The<BR>NOEDUS flag prevents the teacher from teaching educations, even if he would<BR>normally qualify for them.<BR>If this behavior has NO parameters whatsoever, the mob will teach absolutely<BR>everything (unless one of the two flags say otherwise).  Otherwise, the parameters<BR>will dictate what the mob can teach.  Educations will only be taught of the mob<BR>otherwise qualifies for them himself.</PRE>

Remember that a tick is about 4 seconds. An<BR>Area with this behavior will skip over any rooms which also have this behavior,<BR>allowing you to have different total reset times for certain rooms.  Of course,<BR>this behavior does not override the existing REJUV system for mobs and items, so if<BR>you would like to use the ResetWhole system exclusively, you should set the rejuv<BR>rate on all the mobs and items in your game to 0, which disables their internal<BR>rejuvination.</PRE>

The<BR>parameter may be complete scripts, and/or LOAD commands as specified below. If you<BR>choose to use a file for your script, then each script command line must be<BR>terminated by a linefeed or a semicolon.  If you choose to put your entire script<BR>into the parameters, you must terminate EVERY line with a semicolon (;). <BR>Multiple scripts with multiple triggers may be included.  Each script and<BR>trigger must be separated by the ~ character.  See examples in the resources/progs<BR>directory! <BR>Now to the script itself:<BR>The first line must be a trigger word followed by any parameters.  Valid<BR>triggers and parameters are as follows:<BR>LOAD=[SCRIPT PATH] - insert a new script from another file.

The<BR>characteris unnecessary when put around single words 'word'.<BR><BR>*** NOTE If Scriptable is placed on an Item, triggers such as GET_PROG,<BR>DROP_PROG, WEAR_PROG, and REMOVE_PROG will only trigger when the scripted item is<BR>involved. <BR><BR>*** NOTE MASK_PROG and ACT_PROG will check commands as they appear to the mob<BR>with this behavior.  Consider perspective, vision, and word tense in light of this<BR>fact when wording your masks.  For instance, the purchase of a sword in a dark shop<BR>may be seen as 'Someone buys something from someone' instead of 'Bob buys a sword<BR>from Joe'.<BR><BR>Following this line is your script itself.

Remorting is done through your children. <BR>Children are created by using the MATE social with a member of the opposite sex<BR>while the both of you are suitably undressed.  If pregnancy occurs in the female,<BR>birth will occur some 10 mud-months following this.  The child should remain in the<BR>mothers inventory until it can walk, which occurs 9 mud- months following birth. <BR>If the child is Christened by a Cleric with a player legal name, and if the child<BR>remains as a follower of either the father or the mother until it grows up, it will<BR>become a player, which occurs 18-27 mud-months after birth.  If the child does not<BR>remain an active follower, or if it is never Christened, it will grow up to be a<BR>mob, or perhaps not grow up at all! Should the named child grow up, the child will<BR>cease to be a following mob, and become a player which can be logged-in as.  The<BR>child may be a mixed breed of the mother and father if one of them is a Human and<BR>the other is not.  Racial benefits will be split between the mother and father,<BR>though children will have a bonus to their maximum stats when they become a player,<BR>making them a good choice for playing!</PRE>
