      <pre>CoffeeMud File System<br />The CoffeeMud File System is a means of accessing files inside your main<br />CoffeeMud folder along side files stored in your CoffeeMud database.  Files in the<br />CMFS can be stored either in the local file system, in CoffeeMud's database, or in<br />both.  The CMFS sees both sets of files and folders/directories as if they were<br />part of a single file system.<br /><br />Normally, the files required for operation of CoffeeMud, such as text files,<br />class files, help files, images, and other files, are loaded from the appropriate<br />directories on your LOCAL file system inside the main CoffeeMud folder.  If you<br />installed CoffeeMud into D:\games\engines\coff, for instance, the file intro.txt<br />(the intro screen) would be loaded from D:\games\engines\coff\<br />resources\text\intro.txt. <br /><br />Under the CoffeeMud system, however, you should always think of your CoffeeMud<br />folder as a file system unto itself.  The same file discussed above, even when<br />referring to the local file system inside CoffeeMud, would be accessed using the<br />path:  resources/text/intro.txt. You'll notice that the path separators are forward<br />slashes / like in UNIX, instead of the normal back-slashes \ used in DOS.  This is<br />the standard for the CMFS.  You'll also notice that the resources directory is<br />accessed as if it were at the root of its own drive.  This is also part of the<br />CoffeeMud File System.  Because of this, CoffeeMud is utterly unable to access any<br />files outside of its installation directory.  Keep this in mind!<br /><br />Within this installation directory structure, CoffeeMud is able to store files<br />both on your local file system drive, and in your database (VFS Files).  The VFS,<br />or Virtual File System, refers specifically to files and folders which are saved in<br />your database, and accessible through the MUDGrinder's File Browser, or the MUD's<br />SHELL command (see HELP SHELL).  When the CoffeeMud directory structure is viewed<br />through those two screens, files in the CoffeeMud database and files in the local<br />file system are both viewable as if they were part of a single file system, the<br />CMFS.<br /><br />The files referenced in CoffeeMud are case-insensitive, except where dealing<br />with the local file system, where it may be case-sensitive depending upon your<br />operating system.  Any filename or path may be preceded by a :: string to denote<br />forced VFS/database access, or // to denote forced local file-system access.  When<br />neither is specified for a given file path, the VFS file is always preferred over<br />the local one. For instance, the path ::resources/text/intro.txt would refer ONLY<br />to a copy of the intro.txt file stored in the database as a VFS file. If that file<br />is not in the database when the :: string is used, the file will not be found.  The<br />path //resources/text/intro.txt would refer ONLY to the copy of the intro.txt file<br />stored in the local file system, even if the same file appears in the VFS.  The<br />path resources/text/intro.txt will use the copy of intro.txt stored in the VFS *if*<br />it exists there, or the one on the local file system otherwise.<br /><br />The / character is always used to separate directory paths and folders, such as<br />/resources/text/intro.txt would refer to the file down.txt in the text folder,<br />which in turn is in the resources folder, which in turn is located in the root<br />directory.<br /><br />So, as we've seen, whenever you need to refer to a file in CoffeeMud, you<br />should keep this system in mind.  Files which are part of your CMFS may be in the<br />VFS database, or in the local file system.  They may even be in both! This system<br />provides security for the server in which CoffeeMud is being run, and provides for<br />the ability to grant folder-level (or even VFS-folder-level) security to builders<br />and other administrative users.</pre>

This command may also be used to export individual rooms,<br />player data, or unique items or mobs as well.  If the second parameter<br />(ITEMS/MOBS/WEAPONS/etc) is NOT specified, export will produce full room data for<br />the scope of the first parameter (AREA, ROOM, or WORLD). If the second parameter IS<br />specified, then only the specified data will be generated.<br />The results will be written to the file given in the last argument, or to the<br />screen if "screen" is given as the last argument, or sent to your email address if<br />that is enabled.  The extension need not be included, as coffeemud will add it if<br />not present.  If a directory name is given (no file name), the system will<br />reference the AREA ARCHIVE file name for an Area, assuming EXPORT AREA or EXPORT<br />WORLD is used.

You may also enter WORLD to make the world<br />search explicit.<br /><br />The next parameter is the search criteria.  The key phrase WHEN= may optionally<br />precede it to make explicit that you are specifying the search criteria.  The<br />search criteria fields may be separated by &amp;&amp; strings to specify that all of the<br />preceding criteria AND the next single criteria must be true.  The criteria fields<br />may also be separated by || strings to specify that all of the preceding criteria<br />OR the next single criteria may be true.  One of those strings must be present when<br />specifying more than one criteria.<br /><br />Each field in the search criteria must be of the form FIELD=VALUE,<br />FIELD!=VALUE, FIELD$VALUE, FIELD&gt;VALUE, FIELD&lt;VALUE, FIELD&gt;=VALUE, or<br />FIELD&lt;=VALUE.  Where FIELD must be a valid search field.  Enter GMODIFY ? for a<br />complete list of all valid fields.  Not all fields will apply to all object types,<br />so take this into account especially when using &lt; or != operators.  The<br />operators are all normal except for the new one, $, which means that the value is<br />really a regular expression. The VALUE portion of the criteria may be prefixed with<br />modifiers, which include: <br />[ss] to specify that the value refers to a substring of the fields whole value.<br />[cs] to specify that the search is case sensitive (case insensitive is<br />implied).<br /><br />The last parameter is the optional change specifications.  These specifications<br />must be prefixed with the key phrase CHANGE=.  If these specifications are not<br />included, GMODIFY will display the results of the search.  The change<br />specifications are similar to the search criteria in that they consist of groupings<br />of FIELD=VALUE separated by &amp;&amp; strings.  Unlike search criteria, however, operators<br />other than =, and strings other than || have no special meaning.  The fields, like<br />in the search criteria, must be valid fields for the options selected by the search<br />criteria.  The fields on the object will be changed to the specified value UNLESS<br />the following conditions are met: the VALUE portion of a field is prefixed with the<br />modifier [ss], and the VALUE portion of an identical field in the search criteria<br />was also prefixed with the modifier [ss].  Under those special conditions, instead<br />of substituting the entire field value on the object with the new value, ONLY the<br />portion of the string selected in the search criteria will be substituted.</pre>

The first<br />parameter specifies whether the items in the text file are to be merged with those<br />in the entire world, in your current area, or just the room. The second parameter<br />(CHANGE) is implied to be ALL unless specified otherwise. It denotes which fields<br />in the existing items may be changed based on what changes are seen to the item<br />inside the CMARE file.   The third parameter (ON) is implied to be ALL unless<br />specified otherwise.  It denotes how an item in the CMARE file is matched with an<br />existing item in your world.  If the listed fields from the CMARE file and the<br />existing item are equal, the items will be considered a match for the purposes of<br />merging.  The fourth parameter (IGNORE) is implied to be NONE unless specified<br />otherwise.  It denotes exceptions to the (ON) parameter, namely which fields are<br />allowed to differ between items in the CMARE file and an existing item in cases<br />where they would otherwise be considered a match according to the (ON) parameter. <br />Matched items in your existing world, in every room, will be modified accordingly,<br />and the room will be resaved to your database.

It does this by tracking<br />certain pieces of data which together may be taken as rather circumstantial<br />evidence of someone multiplaying.  The definition of the numbers are as follows:<br />SYNC - The number of commands entered by more than one member of an IP group<br />within a single 4 second period. <br />SPEECH - This refers to SAY commands, broken into three sections.  The first<br />number represents the number of SAY commands done in the same room with a player<br />who has the same IP address.  The second number represents the number of SAY<br />commands directed at another player.  The last number is the number of SAY commands<br />total.<br />SOCIALS - These are also divided into three numbers where, again, the first is<br />the number of socials in the same room with a player with the same IP, the second<br />being socials directed at another player, and the last being the number of total<br />socials.<br />CMD - The number of commands entered which are different than the previous<br />command entered.<br />ORDER - The number of times one of the players in the group gave an ORDER to<br />another player in the group.  A sure sign indeed.</pre>

      <pre>Quests are defined as a definable tasks which are completed by players for<br />prizes. These tasks, the monitoring of their completion and status, as well as<br />their availability, can all be automated by CoffeeMud.<br /><br />A quest is created using the CREATE QUEST [SCRIPT] command.  Where [SCRIPT] is<br />a either a complete quest script, where each command line is terminated by a<br />semicolon (;), or a load command of the form LOAD=[SCRIPT PATH].  An example of a<br />create script using a load command is as follows: CREATE QUEST<br />LOAD=/resources/quests/myquest.txt. To load one of the built-in quests, for<br />instance, use CREATE QUEST LOAD=quests/robbed/robbed.quest.<br /><br />Quests may be started manually, or by making them autoquests using the SET WAIT<br />and SET INTERVAL commands below.  Quests may be started manually by using the<br />MODIFY QUEST [QUEST NAME] command.  Quests can be listed, to see their status,<br />using the LIST QUESTS command.  Quests can be removed from the list using the<br />DESTROY QUEST [QUEST NAME] command.  Quests can be saved using the SAVE QUESTS<br />command.  Quests saved this way will be restored during the next CoffeeMud reboot. <br /><br />When creating a new quest using the CREATE QUEST [SCRIPT] command, whether you<br />use the load command to specify an external script, or include the script directly<br />into the create command, the quest script commands are as follows:<br /><br />SET NAME [QUEST NAME] - the *unique* name of your quest. This is a required<br />command!<br /><br />SET DURATION [#TICKS] - # of ticks (4 second periods) the quest will last once<br />started. This is a required command!<br /><br />SET WAIT [#TICKS] - minimum # ticks to wait between auto-starts of the quest.<br />Required for auto-quests only!<br /><br />SET DATE [#DAY]-[#MONTH] - The real-life start-date of the quest. This is a<br />valid substitute for the SET WAIT requirement.<br /><br />SET MUDDAY [#DAY]-[#MONTH] - The start mud-date of the quest, according to the<br />default global mud calendar. This is a valid substitute for the SET WAIT<br />requirement.<br /><br />SET INTERVAL [#TICKS] - random # ticks (1-#TICKS) to wait between auto-starting<br />the quest, AFTER the WAIT period (see above) is over. Required for auto-quests!<br /><br />SET MINPLAYERS [#PLAYERS] - Minimum number of players who must be online for a<br />timed quest to automatically start. See SET PLAYERMASK.<br /><br />SET PLAYERMASK [MASKSTRING] - If this string is empty or not specified, then<br />anyone is considered a player for the purposes of the MINPLAYERS setting above.<br />However, you can specify a "zapper mask" to narrow down the definition of a player.<br /> See HELP ZAPPERMASKS for the list of valid mask values to put here.<br /><br />SET RUNLEVEL [#LEVEL] - Normally, a timed quest will always run when its time<br />comes up.  Setting a value above -1 will prevent this quest from running when its<br />time comes up if another quest is also running at the same or LOWER run level.<br /><br />IMPORT MOBS [XML FILE PATH] - this will import a list of custom mobs from a<br />.CMARE file generated using the EXPORT ROOM MOBS command. The parameter must be the<br />path and file name of the file, using the same format as the LOAD= command<br />mentioned above.  This list can then be accessed with the LOAD MOB, or LOAD<br />MOBGROUP command.<br /><br />IMPORT ITEMS [XML FILE PATH] - this will import a list of custom items from a<br />.CMARE file generated using the EXPORT ROOM ITEMS command. The parameter must be<br />the path and file name of the file, using the same format as the LOAD= command<br />mentioned above.  This list can then be accessed with the LOAD ITEM or LOAD<br />ITEMGROUP command.<br /><br />SET AREA ([AREA NAME OR NAMES]) - will set the current designated area to the<br />area specified. Although this does nothing in itself, it is important for the<br />several commands which load mobs and items. The area name ANY may be given to<br />choose a random area. Several area names may be specified as choices by setting the<br />first area name as ANY, followed by your other area name choices, separated by<br />spaces. If no area name is given, this will CLEAR the area designation. This can<br />have a profound impact on how subsequent mob or item loading, or room setting<br />commands work.<br /><br />SET AREA [OBJECT] - serves the same purpose as the above command of the same<br />name, but the argument is an object specifier.  See Object Specifiers below this<br />command listing.  If the object resolves to a group of objects, a random one from<br />the group will be chosen.<br /><br />SET AREAGROUP ([AREA NAME OR NAMES]) - will set the current designated<br />ROOMGROUP to the areas specified. Although this does nothing in itself, it is<br />important for the several commands which load mobs and items. The area name ANY may<br />be given to choose a random area. The area name ALL will select all world areas.<br />Several area names may be specified as choices by setting the first area name as <br />ANY, followed by your other area name choices, separated by spaces. If no area <br />name is given, this will CLEAR the ROOMGROUP designation. This can have a profound <br />impact on how subsequent mob or item loading, or room setting commands work.<br /><br />SET ROOMGROUP ([ROOM NAME]) - will set the ROOMGROUP to the set specified. If<br />an area has been previously designated, and not cleared (see SET ROOMGROUP), then<br />the rooms will be selected from the designated area according to the room name<br />criteria. Otherwise, rooms from the whole map will be chosen. If a room name of ANY<br />is given, then the rooms will be chosen randomly from the world, or the area if<br />designated.  A room name of ALL will choose all appropriate rooms. Several room <br />names may be specified as choices by setting the first room name as ANY, followed <br />by your other room name choices, separated by spaces. If no room name is given, <br />this will effectly clear the ROOMGROUP designation (but it will not clear the area <br />designation!).  Valid room names include map room IDs such as MyArea#123, or key <br />words from the titles or descriptions of rooms.<br /><br />SET ROOMGROUP [OBJECT] - serves the same purpose as the above command of the<br />same name, but the argument is an object specifier.  See Object Specifiers below<br />this command listing.<br /><br />SET ROOM ([ROOM NAME]) - will set the current designated room to the set<br />specified. If a room or area has been previously designated, and not cleared (see<br />SET AREA), then the room will be selected from the designated area according to the<br />room name criteria. Otherwise, a room from the whole map will be chosen. If a room<br />name of ANY is given, then the room will be chosen randomly from the world, or the<br />area if designated.  Several room names may be specified as choices by setting the<br />first room name as ANY, followed by your other room name choices, separated by<br />spaces.  If no room name is given, this will effectly clear the room designation<br />(but it will not clear the area designation!).   Valid room names include map room<br />IDs such as MyArea#123, or key words from the titles or descriptions of rooms.<br /><br />SET ROOM [OBJECT] - serves the same purpose as the above command of the same<br />name, but the argument is an object specifier.  See Object Specifiers below this<br />command listing.   If the object resolves to a group of objects, a random one from<br />the group will be chosen.<br /><br />SET ROOMGROUPAROUND [#RADIUS] ([ROOM NAME])- will set the ROOMGROUP to the set<br />of rooms up to RADIUS rooms from the previously set ROOM. The rooms will be<br />selected from the set of rooms which are up to RADIUS rooms away from the currently<br />set ROOM (see SET ROOM/SET LOCALE). The radius must then be greater than 0.  If the<br />following room name of ANY is given, then all rooms in the radius are grouped. <br />Several room names may be specified as choices by setting the first room name as<br />ANY, followed by your other room name choices, separated by spaces.  If no room<br />name is given, this will effectly clear the ROOMGROUP designation (but it will not<br />clear the area designation!).     Valid room names include map room IDs such as<br />MyArea#123, or key words from the titles or descriptions of rooms.<br /><br />SET LOCALEGROUP ([LOCALE]) - will set the ROOMGROUP to the ones with the<br />specified class name. If an area has been previously designated, and not cleared<br />(see SET AREA), then the rooms will be selected from the designated area according<br />to the locale criteria. Otherwise, rooms from the whole map will be chosen. If a<br />locale name of ANY is given, then the rooms will be chosen randomly from the world,<br />or the area if designated.  Several locale types may be specified as choices by<br />setting the first locale type as ANY, followed by your other locale type choices,<br />separated by spaces.  If no locale is given, this will effectly clear the ROOMGROUP<br />designation (but it will not clear the area designation!).  Valid locale names may<br />be Locale class names such as MountainSurface, StdRoom, etc, or they may be locale<br />types such as stone, wooden, underwater, mountains, etc.<br /><br />SET LOCALEGROUP [OBJECT] - serves the same purpose as the above command of the<br />same name, but the argument is an object specifier.  See Object Specifiers below<br />this command listing.<br /><br />SET LOCALEGROUPAROUND ([#RADIUS] [LOCALE]) - will set the ROOMGROUP to the ones<br />with the specified class name. The rooms will be selected from the set of rooms<br />which areup to RADIUS rooms away from the currently set ROOM (see SET LOCALE/SET<br />ROOM). The radius must then be greater than 0.  If the following locale name of ANY<br />is given, then all rooms in the radius are grouped.  Several room names may be<br />specified as choices by setting the first locale name as ANY, followed by your<br />other locale name choices, separated by spaces.  If no locale name is given, this<br />will effectly clear the ROOMGROUP designation (but it will not clear the area<br />designation!).   Valid locale names may be Locale class names such as<br />MountainSurface, StdRoom, etc, or they may be locale types such as stone, wooden,<br />underwater, mountains, etc.<br /><br />SET LOCALE ([LOCALE]) - will set the current designated room to the one with<br />the specified class name. If a room or area has been previously designated, and not<br />cleared (see SET AREA), then the room will be selected from the designated area<br />according to the locale criteria. Otherwise, a room from the whole map will be<br />chosen. If a locale of ANY is given, then the room will be chosen randomly from the<br />world, or the area if designated.  Several locale types may be specified as choices<br />by setting the first locale type as ANY, followed by your other locale type<br />choices, separated by spaces.  If no locale is given, this will effectly clear the<br />room designation (but it will not clear the area designation!).   Valid locale<br />names may be Locale class names such as MountainSurface, StdRoom, etc, or they may<br />be locale types such as stone, wooden, underwater, mountains, etc.<br /><br />SET LOCALE [OBJECT] - serves the same purpose as the above command of the same<br />name, but the argument is an object specifier.  See Object Specifiers below this<br />command listing.   If the object resolves to a group of objects, a random one from<br />the group will be chosen.<br /><br />SET MOBGROUP (RESELECT) ([MOB NAME]) - will designate a set of mobs with the<br />given name. If the name ends with MASK=..., then a mask as described by the help entry<br />for ZAPPERMASKS will apply in addition to the name mask<br />entered before the MASK= string.  A mob name of ALL will choose all appropriate <br />mobs. The mobs chosen will be selected from those in the designated ROOMGROUP (if <br />one is designated),  AREA (if one is designated) or the world. The mobs must exist <br />somewhere in the map for this command to work. Normally a mob will not be placed in <br />the mobgroup if the mob has been previously set with SET MOB, or SET MOBTYPE.  The <br />RESELECT flag is an optional first flag which, if specified, designates that  mobs <br />may be placed in the mobgroup even if previously set, so long as the RESELECT flag <br />was also used in the previous SET MOB or SET MOBTYPE command.<br /><br />SET MOBGROUP [OBJECT] - serves the same purpose as the above command of the<br />same name, but the argument is an object specifier.  See Object Specifiers below<br />this command listing<br /><br />SET MOB (RESELECT) ([MOB NAME]) - will set the current mob to one with the<br />given mob name. If the name ends with MASK=..., then a mask as described<br />by the help entry for ZAPPERMASKS will apply in addition to<br />the mob name entered before the MASK= string. The mob chosen will be selected from<br />a MOBGROUP if one has been set. Otherwise, the mob chosen will be selected from<br />those in the designated ROOMGROUP (if one is designated), or the AREA (if one is<br />designated) or finally the world. The mob must exist somewhere one of those groups<br />for this command to work. If a room has been previously designated, then this<br />command will bring the chosen mob to that room. If a room or area has not been<br />designated (or was cleared), then this command will designate a new room and area. <br />Normally a mob will not be chosen by this command if the mob has been previously<br />set with SET MOB, or SET MOBTYPE.  The RESELECT flag is an optional first flag<br />which, if specified, designates that a mob may be chosen if previously chosen, so<br />long as the RESELECT flag was also used in the previous SET MOB or SET MOBTYPE<br />command.<br /><br />SET MOB [OBJECT] - serves the same purpose as the above command of the same<br />name, but the argument is an object specifier.  See Object Specifiers below this<br />command listing.   If the object resolves to a group of objects, a random one from<br />the group will be chosen.<br /><br />SET MOBTYPE (RESELECT) ([CLASS]) - will set the current mob to one with the<br />given class name. Ths mob chosen will be selected from a MOBGROUP if one has been<br />set. Otherwise, the mob chosen will be selected from those in the designated<br />ROOMGROUP (if one is designated), AREA (if one is designated) or the world. The mob<br />must exist somewhere in the map for this command to work. If a room has been<br />previously designated, then this command will bring the mob to that room. If a room<br />or area has not been designated (or was cleared), then this command will designate<br />a new room and area.  Normally a mob will not be chosen by this command if the mob<br />has been previously set with SET MOB, or SET MOBTYPE.  The RESELECT flag is an<br />optional first flag which, if specified, designates that a mob may be chosen if<br />previously chosen, so long as the RESELECT flag was also used in the previous SET<br />MOB or SET MOBTYPE command.<br /><br />SET MOBTYPE [OBJECT] - serves the same purpose as the above command of the same<br />name, but the argument is an object specifier.  See Object Specifiers below this<br />command listing.   If the object resolves to a group of objects, a random one from<br />the group will be chosen.<br /><br />SET ITEMGROUP (RESELECT)  ([ITEM NAME]) - will designate a set of items with<br />the given name. If the name ends with MASK=..., then a mask as described<br />by the help entry for ZAPPERMASKS will apply in addition to<br />the item name entered before the MASK= string. An item name of ALL will select all<br />appropriate items.  The items chosen will be selected from those in the designated <br />ROOMGROUP (if one is designated), the AREA (if one is designated) or the world. The <br />items must exist somewhere in the map for this command to work.  Normally an item <br />will not be placed in the itemgroup if the item has been previously set with SET <br />ITEM, or SET ITEMTYPE.  The RESELECT flag is an optional first flag which, if <br />specified, designates that items may be placed in the itemgroup even if previously <br />set, so long as the RESELECT flag was also used in the previous SET ITEM or SET <br />ITEMTYPE command.<br /><br />SET ITEMGROUP [OBJECT] - serves the same purpose as the above command of the<br />same name, but the argument is an object specifier.  See Object Specifiers below<br />this command listing<br /><br />SET ITEM (RESELECT) ([ITEM NAME]) - will set the current item to one with the<br />given name. The item chosen will be selected from those in the designated ROOMGROUP<br />(if one is designated), AREA (if one is designated) or the world. The item must<br />exist somewhere in a room on the map for this command to work. If a room has been<br />previously designated, then this command will bring the item to that room. If a<br />room or area has not been designated (or was cleared), then this command will<br />designate a new room and area.  Normally an item will not be chosen by this command<br />if the item has been previously set with SET ITEM, or SET ITEMTYPE.

If the mob name ends with MASK=..., then a mask as described<br />by the help entry for ZAPPERMASKS will apply in addition to<br />the mob name entered before MASK= string. This selected mobs will be set as the<br />current MOBGROUP. If a room, roomgroup, or area has been previously designated,<br />then this command will create each mob in that room or random room in the area. If<br />a room or area has not been designated (or was cleared), then this command will<br />designate a random room and area.  This command will also designate the current mob<br />to the last one loaded.<br /><br />LOAD MOB [MOB NAME] - will instantiate a mob of the given name from the list of<br />mobs imported using the IMPORT MOBS command above. If the name ends with MASK=...,<br />then a mask as described by the help entry for ZAPPERMASKS<br />will apply in addition to the name mask entered. This selected mob will be set as<br />the current mob. If a room, roomgroup, or area has been previously designated, then<br />this command will create the mob in that room. If a room or area has not been<br />designated (or was cleared), then this command will designate a random room and<br />area.<br /><br />LOAD ITEMGROUP ([#NUMBER]) [ITEM NAME] - will instantiate all (or optionally,<br />the given number) items of the given name from the list of items imported using the<br />IMPORT ITEMS command above.

This command<br />will also designate the current item to the last one loaded.<br /><br />LOAD ITEM [ITEM NAME] - will instantiate an item of the given name from the<br />list of items imported using the IMPORT ITEMS command above. This item will be set<br />as the current item. If a room, roomgroup, or area has been previously designated,<br />then this command will create the item in that room. If a room or area has not been<br />designated (or was cleared), then this command will designate a random room and<br />area. <br /><br />GIVE ITEM - will give the currently designated item (designated using the SET<br />ITEM, or LOAD ITEM command) to the last designated mob or mobs (designated using<br />the SET MOB, SET MOBGROUP, LOAD MOBGROUP, or LOAD MOB commands).<br /><br />GIVE BEHAVIOR [BEHAVIOR ID] ([PARAMETERS]) - The behavior ID must be a valid<br />behavior class name. The parameters are any parameters you wish to pass to the<br />behavior. This command will give the most recently designated mob, item, area, room<br />or mobgroup (designated using the set or load commands), itemgroup, or roomgroup<br />the above behavior.  The parameters above are optional, and include any text that<br />would be valid for the behavior id specified.  The text may also optionally include<br />embedded references to other quest objects.  See below Object Specifiers in<br />Parameters below for more information on using this feature.<br /><br />GIVE ABILITY [ABILITY ID] ([PARAMETERS]) - The ability ID must be a valid<br />ability class name. The parameters are any parameters you wish to pass to the<br />ability. This command will give the currently designated mob, or mobgroup<br />(designated using the set or load commands) the above ability. The parameters above<br />are optional, and include any text that would be valid for the ability id<br />specified.  The text may also optionally include embedded references to other quest<br />objects.  See below Object Specifiers in Parameters below for more information on<br />using this feature.<br /><br />GIVE AFFECT [ABILITY ID] ([PARAMETERS]) - The ability ID must be a valid<br />ability class name. The parameters are any parameters you wish to pass to the<br />ability. This command will give the currently designated mob, item, room, area, or<br />mobgroup (designated using the set or load commands), itemgroup, or roomgroup the<br />above affect. The parameters above are optional, and include any text that would be<br />valid for the ability id specified.  The text may also optionally include embedded<br />references to other quest objects.  See below Object Specifiers in Parameters below<br />for more information on using this feature.<br /><br />GIVE FOLLOWER [MOB NAME] - The mob name is a mob which will be selected from<br />the list of previously designated mobs (designated using the LOAD MOB, SET MOB, or<br />SET MOBTYPE commands). This mob will be made into a follower of the mob most<br />recently designated using the SET MOB, SET MOBTYPE, or LOAD MOB command. This<br />command does not change the current mob designation, nor does it change the<br />location of either mob.<br /><br />TAKE BEHAVIOR [BEHAVIOR ID] - The behavior ID must be a valid behavior class<br />name. This command will take from the most recently designated mob, item, area,<br />room or mobgroup (designated using the set or load commands), itemgroup, or<br />roomgroup the above behavior.<br /><br />TAKE ABILITY [ABILITY ID] - The ability ID must be a valid ability class name.<br />This command will take from the currently designated mob, or mobgroup (designated<br />using the set or load commands) the above ability. The parameters above are<br />optional, and include any text that would be valid for the ability id specified.<br /><br />TAKE AFFECT [ABILITY ID] - The ability ID must be a valid ability class name.<br />This command will take from the currently designated mob, item, room, area, or<br />mobgroup (designated using the set or load commands), itemgroup, or roomgroup the<br />above affect. <br /><br />RESET- If a ROOM has been designated using SET ROOM, or by any other previously<br />described method, this command will cause that room to reset, or re-load from the<br />database.  If a ROOM is not currently set (or has been unset), but a ROOMGROUP or<br />an AREA has been set, this command will cause all rooms in that set (respectively)<br />to reload from the database.  Doing either can be somewhat time consuming, and may<br />disrupt any players in the rooms affected, as it will cause items to vanish from<br />the floor, and make players and mobs unable to move until the process is completed.<br /><br />&lt;SCRIPT&gt; - This designates the beginning of embedded Javascript in your<br />quest script.  The end is designated by a corresponding &lt;/SCRIPT&gt; tag on its own<br />line.  See the next section for more details.<br /><br />LOAD= ([QUEST FILE]) ([ARGUMENT] ... [ARGUMENT])  - This command will cause the<br />specified external quest script file to be loaded and executed as if it were <br />embedded at the current point in the script.  The  quest  filename is of the same<br />format mentioned above.  When LOAD= is used as a command inside a script, you can<br />also specify one or more space-delimited arguments which will be accessible inside<br />the target quest script as Object Specifiers.  The first argument given, whether it<br />is itself an Object Specifier, or a simple string, will be accessible inside the<br />target quest script as ARG1, the second as ARG2, and so forth.  A special case<br />exists, however, if one of the arguments evaluates to an Object Specifier which<br />represents a group of objects (such as MOBGROUP or ITEMGROUP).  If that case<br />occurs, the LOAD= command will execute once for every object inside the group! See<br />the discussion of Object Specifiers and Object Spcifiers in Parameters for more<br />information.<br /><br />&lt;OPTION&gt; ([QUEST SCRIPT COMMANDS]) &lt;/OPTION&gt; - Putting quest script<br />commands inside of &lt;OPTION&gt; tags means that, for every execution of the quest<br />script, only ONE of the &lt;OPTION&gt; tags will be have their script commands<br />executed.  The one chosen will be selected at random.  If only one &lt;OPTION&gt; tag<br />exists, it will be chosen every time, of course.<br /><br />* Note About #.  In a quest script, anywhere the # sign is used above (such as<br />[#TICKS] or [#PLAYERS], you may enter a normal old every day number (34) or you may<br />enter a valid arithmetic expression using real or integer numbers and any of the<br />following operators: + - *  () ?<br /><br />* Object Specifiers.  Many of the SET ... commands, such as SET MOBGROUP, SET<br />MOB, SET ITEMGROUP, SET ROOM, etc, have forms which allow you to designate their<br />value using an [OBJECT] string.  An [OBJECT] string is one of the following basic<br />quest-script values: "LOADEDMOBS", "LOADEDITEMS", "AREA", "ROOM", "MOBGROUP",<br />"ITEMGROUP", "ROOMGROUP", "ITEM", "ENVOBJ", "STUFF", "MOB", or one of the following<br />mystery quest-script values:  "FACTION", "FACTIONGROUP", "AGENT", "AGENTGROUP",<br />"ACTION", "ACTIONGROUP", "TARGET", "TARGETGROUP", "MOTIVE", "MOTIVEGROUP",<br />"WHEREHAPPENED", "WHEREHAPPENEDGROUP", "WHEREAT", "WHEREATGROUP", "WHENHAPPENED",<br />"WHENHAPPENEDGROUP", "WHENAT", "WHENATGROUP", "TOOL", "TOOLGROUP".  Using the SET<br />command in this way allows you to either COPY an objects value, or re-designate it<br />for the purposes of one of the GIVE ... commands.  If the quest script was executed<br />from inside of another using the LOAD= script command, and arguments were specified<br />from the above objects, you may also have access to argument object specifiers,<br />such as ARG1, ARG2, ... ARGN.  There will be one such object specifier available<br />for each argument passed to the script.  Please note that some object specifiers<br />return single objects (such as MOB, ITEM, ROOM) and some return collections of<br />objects (such as ROOMGROUP, MOBGROUP, ITEMGROUP).  Object specifiers can also be<br />combined using + and - characters.  For instance, MOBGROUP-MOB would return the<br />group of mobs in the MOBGROUP minus the specified MOB while the specifier MOB+ITEM<br />would refer to an object group containing both the specified MOB and the specified<br />ITEM.<br /><br />* Object Specifiers in Parameters. When specifing parameters for the GIVE<br />BEHAVIOR, GIVE ABILITY, or GIVE AFFECT command, you may embed the names of one or<br />more of the Object Specifiers by prefixing the Object Specifier code string with a<br />$ character, and concluding it with a space or other non-alphanumeric character. <br />For instance, the command: "give script GREET_PROG 100; say I love<br />$MOB!!!;~;" would embed the name string for the MOB object specifier inside the<br />in-line script.   In addition to this capability, you may also put a special<br />character after the $ and before the object specifier to manipulate how the name of<br />the object is generated.  Special characters are: '_' (to make the name in<br />uppercase), '&amp;' to remove any prefixed english article words from the name, or '|'<br />to replace all spaces in the name with | characters (which is very useful for<br />QuestChat parameters).<br /><br />Mystery Objects in Quest scripts:<br /><br />In addition to the normal quest objects mentioned above, such as MOB, ITEM,<br />ROOM and so forth, there are also extranous objects and groups intended for use<br />when building logic problem mysteries.

      <pre>SECURITY in CoffeeMud is on a player by player basis.  <br />SYSOP status is defined as the ultimate security to do anything, anywhere, at<br />any time.  Access to all commands in all areas will be available.  SYSOP status is<br />defined in the CoffeeMud ini file entry SYSOPMASK which establishes the player<br />characteristics that designate SYSOPS. All players who meet the requirements of the<br />mask are automatically SYSOPS.<br /><br />Players who are not SYSOPS may also be granted specific privileges.  Each of<br />the privileges may be limited to specific areas, or available globally. Privileges<br />are defined in the Security section of a players settings.  Each security code<br />listed for a player may be either a list of security Groups, or a specific security<br />code.<br /><br />Security GROUPS are also defined in the ini file.  A Security GROUP consists of<br />a group name, and a set of strings or codes representing privileges for that group.<br /> Each group is prefixed in the INI file with the "GROUP_".  However, you should not<br />use the "GROUP_" when adding group priviledges to the Security field of a player. <br />For instance, if you have "GROUP_BUILDER" defined in the INI file, then you would<br />add "BUILDER" to Security when modifying a player in order to make that user part<br />of the BUILDER group.  The security codes which make up each group are implicitly<br />global, but can be qualified as area-only using the keyword "AREA".<br /><br />The following are the default strings or codes which, when found in a players<br />security settings or in a group definition, confer the listed privileges. Each of<br />these settings may be entered as listed below, or prefixed with the word "AREA"<br />followed by a space, followed by the key.  This has the effect of making that<br />privilege only available in or at areas where the Player is listed in the areas<br />"Staff" setting.  For example, the security code "ANNOUNCE" by itself confers the<br />global ability to use the ANNOUNCE command.  The security code "AREA ANNOUNCE"<br />means that the ANNOUNCE command can only be used inside areas where the player is<br />listed as Staff.<br /><br /><br />ABOVELAW=Immunity to the Arrest behavior.<br />AFTER=The ability to use the command of the same name.<br />AHELP=The ability to access administrative help files.<br />ANNOUNCE=The ability to use the command of the same name.<br />AS=The ability to use the command of the same name.<br />AT=The ability to use the command of the same name.<br />BAN=The ability to use the command of the same name, as well as DESTROY BAN,<br />LIST BAN, and access the BAN MUDGrinder feature.<br />BEACON=The ability to use the command of the same name.<br />BOOT=The ability to use the command of the same name.<br />CHARGEN=The ability to use the command of the same name.<br />CLOAK=The ability to use the command of the same name, as well as see those who<br />are cloaked.<br />CMDAREAS=The ability to Create, Modify, and Destroy areas.

See help<br />on CMFS or VFS for the difference between the two.<br /><br />The commands are case-insensitive, except where dealing with the local file<br />system, where it may be case-sensitive depending upon the host system.  As<br />mentioned in the CMFS docs, filenames and paths may be preceded by a :: string to<br />denote forced VFS access, or // to denote forced local file-system access.  When<br />neither is specified for a given shell command, the VFS file is always preferred.<br />The / character is always used to separate directory paths and folders, such as<br />/resources/text/down.txt would refer to the file down.txt in the text folder, which<br />in turn is in the resources folder, which in turn is located in the root directory.<br /><br />The shell command may be entered with no parameter to see the players current<br />directory. When viewing directories, a "-" character will precede a file which<br />exists only in the VFS system.  A "+" character will precede a file which exists in<br />both the local file system and the VFS system.  Since folders always exist in the<br />VFS, they will always be seen with the "+" character preceding them.<br /><br />The shell command can be used to create directories, delete files or<br />directories, copy files, search for files with given names, search inside text<br />files for a text string, display a text file, or edit a text file.  Many commands<br />support a mask to limit the files displayed. The mask may include "*" characters<br />anywhere in the string to match 0 or more unknown characters in the filenames.  A<br />"?" character always matches a single unknown character in a filename. <br /><br />See HELP CMFS for more information on CoffeeMuds file system.</pre>

Entering STAT and the players name brings up the most basic SCORE<br />information.  Including a skill type before the name will list their abilities of<br />that type.  Valid skill types include: SKILL, SPELL, PRAYER, SONG, TRAP, PROPERTY,<br />"THIEF SKILL", LANGUAGE, CHANT, "COMMON SKILL", DISEASE, POISON.

      <pre>Tattoo's are intended to act as miscellaneous flags which players may obtain,<br />not unlike a quest point.  These tattoo's can then be checked for as requirements<br />to enter rooms or exits, or to possess certain items.<br />An example would be like this:  The completion of a specific quest occurs when<br />Gunther defeats the evil sorcerer Nunder and enters his inner chamber (where all<br />the treasure is hidden).  Entering this inner chamber automatically grants Gunther<br />a Tatto called "NUNDERKILLER".  Now, elsewhere in the realm is the second quest<br />where Nunder's apprentice has escaped with an ancient artifact and is up to no<br />good.  However, to even ENTER the area where Nunder's apprentice is operating, the<br />system (via the Prop_ReqTattoo property on this other Area) requires that Gunther<br />already have the "NUNDERKILLER" Tattoo.  If Gunther had not defeated Nunder and<br />obtained the "NUNDERKILLER" Tattoo, he would not be allowed into the realm of<br />Nunder's apprentice.</pre>
