      <P><A name=#CMFS><B>CMFS</B></A> <BR><BR><BR><PRE>CoffeeMud File System<BR>The CoffeeMud File System is a means of accessing files inside your main<BR>CoffeeMud folder along side files stored in your CoffeeMud database.  Files in the<BR>CMFS can be stored either in the local file system, in CoffeeMud's database, or in<BR>both.  The CMFS sees both sets of files and folders/directories as if they were<BR>part of a single file system.<BR><BR>Normally, the files required for operation of CoffeeMud, such as text files,<BR>class files, help files, images, and other files, are loaded from the appropriate<BR>directories on your LOCAL file system inside the main CoffeeMud folder.  If you<BR>installed CoffeeMud into D:\games\engines\coff, for instance, the file intro.txt<BR>(the intro screen) would be loaded from D:\games\engines\coff\<BR>resources\text\intro.txt. <BR><BR>Under the CoffeeMud system, however, you should always think of your CoffeeMud<BR>folder as a file system unto itself.  The same file discussed above, even when<BR>referring to the local file system inside CoffeeMud, would be accessed using the<BR>path:  resources/text/intro.txt. You'll notice that the path separators are forward<BR>slashes / like in UNIX, instead of the normal back-slashes \ used in DOS.  This is<BR>the standard for the CMFS.  You'll also notice that the resources directory is<BR>accessed as if it were at the root of its own drive.  This is also part of the<BR>CoffeeMud File System.  Because of this, CoffeeMud is utterly unable to access any<BR>files outside of its installation directory.  Keep this in mind!<BR><BR>Within this installation directory structure, CoffeeMud is able to store files<BR>both on your local file system drive, and in your database (VFS Files).  The VFS,<BR>or Virtual File System, refers specifically to files and folders which are saved in<BR>your database, and accessible through the MUDGrinder's File Browser, or the MUD's<BR>SHELL command (see HELP SHELL).  When the CoffeeMud directory structure is viewed<BR>through those two screens, files in the CoffeeMud database and files in the local<BR>file system are both viewable as if they were part of a single file system, the<BR>CMFS.<BR><BR>The files referenced in CoffeeMud are case-insensitive, except where dealing<BR>with the local file system, where it may be case-sensitive depending upon your<BR>operating system.  Any filename or path may be preceded by a :: string to denote<BR>forced VFS/database access, or // to denote forced local file-system access.  When<BR>neither is specified for a given file path, the VFS file is always preferred over<BR>the local one. For instance, the path ::resources/text/intro.txt would refer ONLY<BR>to a copy of the intro.txt file stored in the database as a VFS file. If that file<BR>is not in the database when the :: string is used, the file will not be found.  The<BR>path //resources/text/intro.txt would refer ONLY to the copy of the intro.txt file<BR>stored in the local file system, even if the same file appears in the VFS.  The<BR>path resources/text/intro.txt will use the copy of intro.txt stored in the VFS *if*<BR>it exists there, or the one on the local file system otherwise.<BR><BR>The / character is always used to separate directory paths and folders, such as<BR>/resources/text/intro.txt would refer to the file down.txt in the text folder,<BR>which in turn is in the resources folder, which in turn is located in the root<BR>directory.<BR><BR>So, as we've seen, whenever you need to refer to a file in CoffeeMud, you<BR>should keep this system in mind.  Files which are part of your CMFS may be in the<BR>VFS database, or in the local file system.  They may even be in both! This system<BR>provides security for the server in which CoffeeMud is being run, and provides for<BR>the ability to grant folder-level (or even VFS-folder-level) security to builders<BR>and other administrative users.</PRE>

This command may also be used to export individual rooms,<BR>player data, or unique items or mobs as well.  If the second parameter<BR>(ITEMS/MOBS/WEAPONS/etc) is NOT specified, export will produce full room data for<BR>the scope of the first parameter (AREA, ROOM, or WORLD).

You may also enter WORLD to make the world<BR>search explicit.<BR><BR>The next parameter is the search criteria.  The key phrase WHEN= may optionally<BR>precede it to make explicit that you are specifying the search criteria.  The<BR>search criteria fields may be separated by &amp;&amp; strings to specify that all of the<BR>preceding criteria AND the next single criteria must be true.  The criteria fields<BR>may also be separated by || strings to specify that all of the preceding criteria<BR>OR the next single criteria may be true.  One of those strings must be present when<BR>specifying more than one criteria.<BR><BR>Each field in the search criteria must be of the form FIELD=VALUE,<BR>FIELD!=VALUE, FIELD$VALUE, FIELD&gt;VALUE, FIELD&lt;VALUE, FIELD&gt;=VALUE, or<BR>FIELD&lt;=VALUE.  Where FIELD must be a valid search field.  Enter GMODIFY ? for a<BR>complete list of all valid fields.  Not all fields will apply to all object types,<BR>so take this into account especially when using &lt; or != operators.  The<BR>operators are all normal except for the new one, $, which means that the value is<BR>really a regular expression. The VALUE portion of the criteria may be prefixed with<BR>modifiers, which include: <BR>[ss] to specify that the value refers to a substring of the fields whole value.<BR>[cs] to specify that the search is case sensitive (case insensitive is<BR>implied).<BR><BR>The last parameter is the optional change specifications.  These specifications<BR>must be prefixed with the key phrase CHANGE=.  If these specifications are not<BR>included, GMODIFY will display the results of the search.  The change<BR>specifications are similar to the search criteria in that they consist of groupings<BR>of FIELD=VALUE separated by &amp;&amp; strings.  Unlike search criteria, however, operators<BR>other than =, and strings other than || have no special meaning.  The fields, like<BR>in the search criteria, must be valid fields for the options selected by the search<BR>criteria.  The fields on the object will be changed to the specified value UNLESS<BR>the following conditions are met: the VALUE portion of a field is prefixed with the<BR>modifier [ss], and the VALUE portion of an identical field in the search criteria<BR>was also prefixed with the modifier [ss].  Under those special conditions, instead<BR>of substituting the entire field value on the object with the new value, ONLY the<BR>portion of the string selected in the search criteria will be substituted.</PRE>

      <P><A name=#QUESTS><B>QUESTS</B></A> <BR><BR><BR><PRE>Quests are defined as a definable tasks which are completed by players for<BR>prizes. These tasks, the monitoring of their completion and status, as well as<BR>their availability, can all be automated by CoffeeMud.<BR><BR>A quest is created using the CREATE QUEST [SCRIPT] command.  Where [SCRIPT] is<BR>a either a complete quest script, where each command line is terminated by a<BR>semicolon (;), or a load command of the form LOAD=[SCRIPT PATH].  An example of a<BR>create script using a load command is as follows: CREATE QUEST<BR>LOAD=c:/temp/myquest.txt. To load one of the built-in quests, for instance, use<BR>CREATE QUEST LOAD=quests/robbed/robbed.quest.<BR><BR>Quests may be started manually, or by making them autoquests using the SET WAIT<BR>and SET INTERVAL commands below.  Quests may be started manually by using the<BR>MODIFY QUEST [QUEST NAME] command.  Quests can be listed, to see their status,<BR>using the LIST QUESTS command.  Quests can be removed from the list using the<BR>DESTROY QUEST [QUEST NAME] command.  Quests can be saved using the SAVE QUESTS<BR>command.  Quests saved this way will be restored during the next CoffeeMud reboot. <BR><BR>When creating a new quest using the CREATE QUEST [SCRIPT] command, whether you<BR>use the load command to specify an external script, or include the script directly<BR>into the create command, the quest script commands are as follows:<BR><BR>SET NAME [QUEST NAME] - the *unique* name of your quest.  This is a required<BR>command!<BR><BR>SET DURATION [#TICKS] - # of ticks (4 second periods) the quest will last once<BR>started. This is a required command!<BR><BR>SET WAIT [#TICKS] - minimum # ticks to wait between auto-starts of the quest.<BR>Required for auto-quests only!<BR><BR>SET DATE DAY-MONTH - The real-life start date of the quest.<BR><BR>SET MUDDAY DAY-MONTH - The mud-day (according to the global clock) to start the<BR>quest.<BR><BR>SET INTERVAL [#TICKS] - random # ticks (1-#TICKS) to wait between auto-starting<BR>the quest, AFTER the WAIT period (see above) is over. Required for auto-quests!<BR><BR>SET MINPLAYERS [#PLAYERS] - Min players to start timed quest. See PLAYERMASK.<BR><BR>SET PLAYERMASK [MASKSTRING] - Defines a "player" for minplayers.  See<BR>Prop_HaveZapper.<BR><BR>SET RUNLEVEL [#LEVEL] - Prevents starting timed quest if another quest is<BR>running with lower or equal level.  A value of -1 disables this feature.<BR><BR>IMPORT MOBS [XML FILE PATH] - this will import a list of custom mobs from a<BR>.CMARE file generated using the EXPORT ROOM MOBS command. The parameter must be the<BR>path and file name of the file.<BR><BR>IMPORT ITEMS [XML FILE PATH] - this will import a list of custom items from a<BR>.CMARE file generated using the EXPORT ROOM ITEMS command. The parameter must be<BR>the path and file name of the file.<BR><BR>SET AREA ([AREA NAME]) - will set the current designated area to the area<BR>specified.  Although this does nothing in itself, it is important for  the several<BR>commands which load mobs and items.  The area name ANY may be given to choose a<BR>random area.  Several area names may be specified as choices by setting the first<BR>area name listed is ANY.  If no area name is given, this will  CLEAR the area<BR>designation.  This can have a profound impact on how subsequent mob or item<BR>loading, or room setting commands work.<BR><BR>SET ROOM ([ROOM NAME]) - will set the current designated room to the one<BR>specified.  If a room or area has been previously designated, and not cleared (see<BR>SET AREA), then the room will be selected from the designated area according to the<BR>room name criteria.  Otherwise, a room from the whole map will be chosen.  If a<BR>room name of ANY is given, then the room will be chosen randomly from the world, or<BR>the area if designated.  Several room names may be specified as choices by setting<BR>the first room name listed as ANY.  If no room name is given, this will effectly<BR>clear the room designation (but it will not clear the area designation!).<BR><BR>SET LOCALE ([LOCALE]) - will set the current designated room to the one with<BR>the specified class name.

Otherwise, a room from the whole map will be<BR>chosen.  If a locale of ANY is given, then the room will be chosen randomly from<BR>the world, or the area if designated.  Several locale types may be specified as<BR>choices by making the first locale type listed ANY. If no locale is given, this<BR>will effectly clear the room designation (but it will not clear the area<BR>designation!).<BR><BR>SET MOBGROUP ([MOB NAME]) - will designate a set of mobs with the given name.<BR>If the name ends with MASK=..., then a mask similar in functionality to the one<BR>described in the Prop_HaveZapper will apply in addition to the name mask entered.<BR>The mobs chosen will be selected from those in the designated area (if one was<BR>designated) or the world.

If a room or area has not been designated (or was<BR>cleared), then this command will designate a new room and area.<BR><BR>SET ITEM ([ITEM NAME]) - will set the current item to one with the given name.<BR>The item chosen will be selected from those in the designated area (if one was<BR>designated) or the world.  The item must exist somewhere in a room on the map for<BR>this command to work.  If a room has been previously designated, then this command<BR>will bring the item to that room.  If a room or area has not been designated (or<BR>was cleared), then this command will designate a new room and area.<BR><BR>SET ITEMTYPE ([CLASS]) - will set the current item to one with the given class<BR>name. The item chosen will be selected from those in the designated area (if one<BR>was designated) or the world.  The item must exist somewhere in a room on the map<BR>for this command to work.  If a room has been previously designated, then this<BR>command will bring the item to that room.  If a room or area has not been<BR>designated (or was cleared), then this command will designate a new room and area.<BR><BR>LOAD MOB [MOB NAME] - will instantiate a mob of the given name from the list of<BR>mobs imported using the IMPORT MOBS command above.  If the name ends with MASK=...,<BR>then a mask similar in functionality to the one described in the Prop_HaveZapper<BR>will apply in addition to the name mask entered. This selected mob will be set as<BR>the current mob. If a room has been previously designated, then this command will<BR>create the mob in that room.  If a room or area has not been designated (or was<BR>cleared), then this command will designate a random room and area.<BR><BR>LOAD ITEM [ITEM NAME] - will instantiate an item of the given name from the<BR>list of items imported using the IMPORT ITEMS command above.  This item will be set<BR>as the current item. If a room has been previously designated, then this command<BR>will create the item in that room.  If a room or area has not been designated (or<BR>was cleared), then this command will designate a random room and area.<BR><BR>GIVE ITEM - will give the currently designated item (designated using the SET<BR>ITEM, or LOAD ITEM command) to the currently designated mob (designated using the<BR>SET MOB, or LOAD MOB command).  <BR><BR>GIVE BEHAVIOR [BEHAVIOR ID] [PARAMETERS] - The behavior ID must be a valid<BR>behavior class name.  The parameters are any parameters you wish to pass to the<BR>behavior.  This command will give the currently designated mob, item, or mobgroup<BR>(designated using the set or load commands) the above behavior. <BR><BR>GIVE ABILITY [ABILITY ID] [PARAMETERS] - The ability ID must be a valid ability<BR>class name.  The parameters are any parameters you wish to pass to the ability. <BR>This command will give the currently designated mob, or mobgroup (designated using<BR>the set or load commands) the above ability. <BR><BR>GIVE AFFECT [ABILITY ID] [PARAMETERS] - The ability ID must be a valid ability<BR>class name.  The parameters are any parameters you wish to pass to the ability. <BR>This command will give the currently designated mob, item, or mobgroup (designated<BR>using the set or load commands) the above affect. <BR><BR>GIVE FOLLOWER [MOB NAME] - The mob name is a mob which will be selected from<BR>the list of previously designated mobs (designated using the load or set mob<BR>commands). This mob will be made into a follower of the CURRENTLY designated mob. <BR>This command does not change the current mob designation, nor does it change the<BR>location of either mob.<BR><BR>RESET - Will reload an area if an area is set and a room is not, or a room if<BR>one is set.<BR><BR>Final notes: This stuff may seem complicated, but just make sure you carefully<BR>examine the sample quests found in the CoffeeMud resources directory!

      <P><A name=#SECURITY><B>SECURITY</B></A> <BR><BR><BR><PRE>SECURITY in CoffeeMud is on a player by player basis.  <BR>SYSOP status is defined as the ultimate security to do anything, anywhere, at<BR>any time.  Access to all commands in all areas will be available.  SYSOP status is<BR>defined in the CoffeeMud ini file entry SYSOPMASK which establishes the player<BR>characteristics that designate SYSOPS. All players who meet the requirements of the<BR>mask are automatically SYSOPS.<BR><BR>Players who are not SYSOPS may also be granted specific privileges.  Each of<BR>the privileges may be limited to specific areas, or available globally. Privileges<BR>are defined in the Security section of a players settings.  Each security code<BR>listed for a player may be either a list of security Groups, or a specific security<BR>code.<BR><BR>Security GROUPS are also defined in the ini file.  A Security GROUP consists of<BR>a group name, and a set of strings or codes representing privileges for that group.<BR> Each group is prefixed in the INI file with the "GROUP_".  However, you should not<BR>use the "GROUP_" when adding group priviledges to the Security field of a player. <BR>For instance, if you have "GROUP_BUILDER" defined in the INI file, then you would<BR>add "BUILDER" to Security when modifying a player in order to make that user part<BR>of the BUILDER group.  The security codes which make up each group are implicitly<BR>global, but can be qualified as area-only using the keyword "AREA".<BR><BR>The following are the default strings or codes which, when found in a players<BR>security settings or in a group definition, confer the listed privileges. Each of<BR>these settings may be entered as listed below, or prefixed with the word "AREA"<BR>followed by a space, followed by the key.  This has the effect of making that<BR>privilege only available in or at areas where the Player is listed in the areas<BR>"Staff" setting.  For example, the security code "ANNOUNCE" by itself confers the<BR>global ability to use the ANNOUNCE command.
