      <p>This is a complicated topic, but one that all builders  and Archons should
         understand.&nbsp; Sooner or later, every CoffeeMud  adminstrator
is   going      to want to modify some of the local files in the CoffeeMud
 folder.&nbsp;        This may include the quests, or skill lists, or hopefully 
 the  intro.txt       file located in resources/text directory!&nbsp; Builders 
 will also  want     to add files, including MOBPROG script files that run 
 in the Scriptable     behavior,  item and mob CMARE files for the RandomMobs 
 behavior or for   other    scripts,  Quest scripts, and other things.&nbsp; 
 </p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>Pretty soon, your directories are packed with stuff customized to your
          mud.&nbsp; This can create issues for back-ups, meaning that not
 only     do   you  have to back-up your database (or your data directory)&nbsp; 
   but   you   have to  backup all those files that have been modified and 
 added,   since  they play as  integral a role in your world as the rooms 
and areas   do.&nbsp;  All those files  can also create upgrade issues, as 
modified  files  can get  accidently overwritten  when a new version of CoffeeMud 
is  overlayed  in your  installation  directory.&nbsp; Lastly, this can create 
   security issues, as  the builders might  accidently delete the wrong file, 
   or make a mistake, creating problems for the  admins as they try to recover.</p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>To help solve these problems, the CoffeeMud engine uses a kind of mirrored
          file system called <strong>CMFS</strong> to store some files in
your     local     directory (your hard drive), some files in your database,
and   some  files    in both  at the same time.&nbsp; When the exact same
file  in the  exact same   directory is  found in BOTH the local file system
and  in the  database, the   one in the database  is always preferred.&nbsp; 
 That   way,  should the file   in the database (called a  <strong>VFS</strong>&nbsp;file)
     become corrupted   or deleted, the one in the  local file system will
 remain    safe.&nbsp; Furthermore,   since&nbsp;files in the  database (VFS
 files)   are always accessed before  the same file in the local file  system,
 you  can overwrite the files in the  local file system with upgrades  without 
  worrying about losing your changed  files.&nbsp; And lastly, CoffeeMud 
provides  a security system that allows  you to grant access to users on a
folder  level, and also to specify whether  the user can access the local 
file system, or  only the database VFS files  and folders.</p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>The CMFS includes everything in your CoffeeMud installation directory/folder,
          and all the other folders therein.&nbsp; In fact, CoffeeMud is
utterly        unable  to  access any files OUTSIDE of your CoffeeMud installation
 folder,      giving  the  server administrator an added level of comfort.&nbsp;
 The   CMFS   is also  able to  access the VFS files in the CoffeeMud database, 
   and to  give them  preference over  identically named files in your local 
   file system.</p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>CMFS employs the&nbsp;UNIX standard for separating directorys and folders.&nbsp;
          This means that the forward slash / character is used when separating
      one   folder  from another when naming a file.&nbsp; The CMFS path
 <strong>/resources/text/intro.txt</strong>         would, for example, refer
to the file  called intro.txt inside the  text     directory,  which is inside
the resources  directory, which is in  your  CoffeeMud   installation  folder.</p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>If that file had been previously copied into the same directory in the
         VFS  database, then the CMFS would prefer that version over the
one    that     remains in  the local file system.&nbsp; You may modify the
file     <strong>resources/text/intro.txt,      </strong>update it, and save
it  without   needing to remember that you  are    really changing a file
in the database.&nbsp;   CoffeeMud will always  remember    to prefer to
the one in the VFS to the  one on  your local hard  drive, if   it has been
copied  or saved there.&nbsp;  </p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>If for some reason you absolutely need to ensure that ONLY&nbsp;the local
          file system version of a file or ONLY the VFS version of a file
is   referenced      by  CoffeeMud, you may do so by prepending a special
string   to your file      paths.&nbsp; The string is double-colon :: to
force access   of a VFS file,      and  double-forward-slash // to force
access of a local   file system file.&nbsp;      For  instance, if the Scriptable
prog resources/progs/myprog.script    is   located   in  both your local
and VFS file systems, then you can force    Scriptable    to  use the  VFS
version by&nbsp;using &nbsp;<strong>::resources/progs/myprog.script     
    </strong>as your path name.&nbsp; If you needed to force Scriptable 
  to   load  the  local file system version of the file <strong>//resources/progs/myprog.script
          </strong>would do the trick.&nbsp; Again, <strong>resources/progs/myprog.script
          </strong>alone, without any special prepended file, will prefer
the    VFS    file,  but will use the local file if a VFS file is unavailable.&nbsp;
     This   is the  preferred behavior, so your Scriptable filenames should
  employ   the   normal path  naming standard except under very extraordinary
  circumstances.</p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>Files can be copied into the VFS from the local file system using the Archon
 SHELL command.&nbsp; If you were to go into the coffeemud resources folder
using  this command:</p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><strong><font face="Courier New">shell cd /resources</font></strong></p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>if you now view the directory</p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><strong><font face="Courier New">shell dir</font></strong></p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>you'll see all the files in your local filesystem in the resources folder
         in  your coffeemud installation directory.&nbsp; Now, you may copy
  all    of   the files  in this directory into the *same* directory in the
  VFS database      by entering:</p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><strong><font face="Courier New">shell copy *  ::/resources</font></strong></p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>the copy command here is followed by a wild-card character,  the&nbsp;asterisk,
         to designate ALL files in the resources directory.&nbsp; The  next
  parameter       is the destination folder.&nbsp; In this case, we specify
  our  destination       as ::/resources, which would be the same directory,
  but in the VFS  system.&nbsp;      Notice that we did not have to create
 a VFS folder called  /resources  before    we did this.&nbsp; The VFS always
  has a mirror copy of all the  local file    system folders.&nbsp; However,
  it requires you to use the SHELL COPY  command    to create a mirror of
the  files themselves.&nbsp; Now, look at the  directory    again:</p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><strong><font face="Courier New">shell dir /resources</font></strong></p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>We displayed the directory this time using an absolute path name, just
         to  show you the syntax.&nbsp; You are still looking at the same
directory         you saw  when you entered <strong><font face="Courier New">shell dir</font></strong>.         In  fact, you can
enter that command again to prove it.&nbsp; You'll    see    that all of
 the files have little "+" marks next to them.&nbsp;  This  means    that
the files  exist both in your local file system *AND*  in the  VFS.&nbsp;
   Now suppose we did  something silly, like delete our  local file system
version    of  resources/socials.txt. This could be done  with the following
command:</p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><strong><font face="Courier New">shell delete  //resources/socials.txt</font></strong></p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>Notice that we used the double-slash // to designate that we want to delete
          the LOCAL version.&nbsp; Had we not put those two slashes in front,
    it   would   have preferred the VFS copy of socials.txt and deleted that 
   one instead.&nbsp;     Now, look at the directory again:</p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><strong><font face="Courier New">shell dir *</font></strong></p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>This time we displayed the directory using an * wildcard, just to demonstrate
          that we can use mask characters when displaying directories.&nbsp; 
   The    command   is doing the same thing the previous two <strong><font face="Courier New">shell  dir</font></strong> commands did, just in a different
         way.&nbsp; Now, you'll see  that most of the files still have the
 "+"    sign    in front, but  now&nbsp;<strong>socials.txt</strong> only
has a  "-"  character.&nbsp;     This&nbsp;means that the file exists only
in the&nbsp;VFS    database, and   not on  our local hard drive.&nbsp; We
can copy it back  to  our local file   system by  doing:&nbsp;</p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><strong><font face="Courier New">shell copy&nbsp;::socials.txt  //</font></strong></p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>You'll see that I changed the syntax of the copy command around again to
 demonstrate some of the previous lessons.&nbsp; We use the :: characters
         in  front of the filename socials.txt to specify that we want to
copy     the    VFS  version of the file.&nbsp; Since the VFS version is
always  preferred       and  accessed first, the copy command would have
worked just  fine without       the two ::  characters in front.&nbsp; The
last parameter  is just two   slash    marks.&nbsp;  When no directory or
folder is specified,  the default   and  current  directory is  used.&nbsp;
In this case, we only  specified the  two  slash marks  to denote the  local
file system, and we  did not specify   a destination   folder.&nbsp;  This
means  that the file  socials.txt will   be copied into  the current folder,
 on the local  file  system only.</p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>There are numerous other shell commands you can make use of, such as <strong><font face="Courier New">makedirectory</font></strong> to create new  folders, 
   <strong><font face="Courier New">edit</font></strong> to modify a text 
 file,  <strong><font face="Courier New">findfile</font></strong> to hunt 
down a  file with a given name, or <strong><font face="Courier New">searchtext</font></strong>
         to find a file containing a given  text string. The shell command
 is   a  useful   tool for mirror your local files in  your VFS database
for  safety,     convenience,   and easy back-ups.</p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>The last topic concerning the CMFS is about security.&nbsp; At the top
         of  this Guide, the subject of security codes was discussed.&nbsp;
  Well,      CMFS  provides its own security codes to limit access to files
  and folders      in either  the local file system, the VFS, or both.&nbsp;
  </p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>By default, a user is not allowed to access any files in either file system,
          unless they are an Archon or have been given a CMFS security code.&nbsp;
         The two  security codes are <strong>FS: [ABSOLUTE_PATH]</strong>
and    <strong>VFS:      [ABSOLUTE_PATH].&nbsp; </strong>In cmfs security
codes,    the [absolute  path]   is a  path name starting from inside your
coffeemud    directory, with  no path-separating    slashes&nbsp; except
to separate  directories  or to designate&nbsp;that the  last  file is really&nbsp;a&nbsp;directory
    by using a trailing forward  slash.&nbsp;&nbsp;  </p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>For example, to give a user access ONLY to files in the VFS database folder
          /resources/text/, you would give the user security code <strong>VFS:
      RESOURCES/TEXT/   </strong>The user would then have permission to view 
   or   delete  any of the   VFS database versions of files that have been 
 copied    into that  directory   from the local file system.&nbsp; The user 
 would  also  have permission  to   create new files or create new directories 
 in  the VFS  inside that  folder.&nbsp;   Directories and files created by
 such  a user,  who only has a VFS  security   code, would not create ANY
files  in your local  file system.&nbsp; All  files   would reside only in
the VFS  database.&nbsp;  This user would not even be   able to copy existing

      <p>To give the same user access to BOTH the local file system and VFS versions
          of the resources/text directory, the security code would need to
 changed        to  <strong>FS: RESOURCES/TEXT/&nbsp; </strong>Using FS instead
 of VFS    gives   the  user access to both local and database versions of
 those files.&nbsp;       </p>












                     
Of course, by default, an Archon has access to both versions of the entire
          coffeemud installation folder.&nbsp; It would be as if the Archon
  had    the    security code <strong>FS:</strong> With no directory specified, 
   the   Archon   has  local file system (and implied VFS)&nbsp; access to 
 the  root   directory   and  everything underneath it.&nbsp; For that reason, 
  when limiting   access   to the  file system, it is best to use the VFS: 
 security code, and  to always   designate a  limited directory path in which 
 your adminitrative   user may  play (upload their  files, save their scripts, 
 etc).

      <p>In the lexicon of the Archons, the word "Ability" encompasses a
great many powers and skills, both natural and man-made. &nbsp;An
ability may behave as an Affect, as a Skill, or as Both. &nbsp;</p>










      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>An ability behaving as an Affect means that it is acting as a
discrete aspect of some existing thing, whether that thing is a room,
an exit, an item, or a mob. &nbsp;Such aspects may include the property
of great strength,&nbsp;great damaging ability, immunity to certain
affects, or simply the garbling of normal speech. &nbsp; An ability
taking on this role is both passive and reactionary; passive when it is
embueing its host with great strength or damage, and reactionary when
it is providing immunity or garbling speech. &nbsp;</p>










      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>An ability that is behaving as a Skill means that it allows its host
(which is always a MOB in this case) to interact with the world around
it, to change it, derive information from it, or beslow Affects upon
it. &nbsp;Such interactions can include kicking, making sick,
poisoning, identifying, catching on fire, and many other things.
&nbsp;An ability taking on this role is entirely active, though once
the active interaction ends, that same Ability may either end (as a
kick), leave itself behind on its target to remain as an Affect as
described above (as catching on fire would).</p>










      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>CoffeeMud contains over a thousand different java-coded Abilities
which fall into numerous other categories and genera of various
descriptions. &nbsp;The most important of those categories, however,
are their Ability Type. &nbsp;CoffeeMud has numerous different ability
types, which include Properties (which always act only as Affects), or
Skills, Spells, Prayers, Chants, Diseases, Poisons, etc. (all of which
can act purely as&nbsp;Skills, act purely as an Affects, or act as Both
depending on the context in which it is used). &nbsp;Whenever you place
the name of an ability in the Affects list of a mob, item, room, or
exit, you are telling CoffeeMud to use only the Affect/property aspect
of that skill. &nbsp;When you place the same ability name in the same
mob's Abilities list, you are telling CoffeeMud to reserve the ability
for use as a Skill. &nbsp;For example,&nbsp;when you&nbsp;add
Spell_GiantStrength to a GenMob's affects list, you are saying that
this mob is permanently stronger than normal, but when you place it on
the GenMob's abilities list, you are saying that you want the mob to be
able to invoke the skill at a later date (by casting the spell).</p>










      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>CoffeeMud also allows you to define abilities outside of the
java-realm. &nbsp;This can be done from the command line using the
CREATE command. &nbsp;If you want to create a new skill called Poke,
for instance, you might enter:</p>

      <p>And it would be done.&nbsp; &nbsp;The "Skill_Poke" is the abilities
Ability ID. &nbsp;The fact that it starts with "Skill_" is merely for
descriptive purposes, and is not required. &nbsp;Generally speaking, it
is a good idea to give your abilities Ability ID's that start with the
general kind of ability it is, for instance "Spell_", "Chant_",
"Prayer_", etc.</p>

      <p>CoffeeMud supports several different class-systems through its
coffeemud.ini file (the CLASSSYSTEM entry). One such option is the
Single-class system, whereby the player can select a single class to
play throughout their characters gaming career. &nbsp;Another is the
Sub-classing system, whereby the player selects a parent-class to play,
but may add/change to any of that parent classes sub-classes to gain a
different selection of skills as they go forward in levels. &nbsp;A
third is the multi-classing system, whereby the player can select an
initial class, but may add/change to any other class to gain a
different selection of skills as they go forward in levels. &nbsp;The
last option is &nbsp;to disable the class system altogether, which
essentially only means that the player is not allowed to choose which
class they play, but are secretly forced into a single class that
determines their skill selection. &nbsp;See your coffeemud.ini file for
more information on this feature.</p>








      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>CoffeeMud includes numerous character classes by default that
give players access to the hundreds of skills in the CoffeeMud
codebase. &nbsp;However, they doesn't mean there isn't room for change,
improvement, or addition. &nbsp;</p>








      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>Customized player or mob classes can be used as skill templates for mobs created using  the
  Fighterness       (or similar) behaviors, or as genuine player classes
for   your  game.&nbsp;       Either way, here is how it is done:</p>

      <p>And it would be done.&nbsp; The name Boxer is just an example.
&nbsp;You can enter any non-space string to serve as an official ID for
your character class. &nbsp;You can even specify the name of an
existing code-base class, such as Fighter or Mage. &nbsp;If you specify
your own name, you are creating a new class from scratch. &nbsp;If you
specify an existing class name, you are essentially "over-riding" that
standard class. &nbsp;This can be a quick and easy way to disable
existing standard classes, since you can create a generic character
class called Fighter, for instance, then set it so that players can not
select it, which effectively disables that character class.</p>








      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>After a character class is created using the CREATE CLASS
command, it can be deleted or modified later using the DESTROY CLASS or
MODIFY CLASS commands.</p>

      <p>A faction can be viewed very simply as a glorified tattoo with
a number value. &nbsp;Normal Tattoos are simply flags which a mob or
player
can have: either you do or do not have the tattoo. &nbsp;A Faction is a
kind of flag a mob or player
can have that has a special a numeric value assigned to
it.&nbsp;
Another way to view a faction is as a relationship between a mob or
player and some idea, such as Goodness, Evilness, Orc Affinity,
Reputation,
or some other idea.&nbsp; For example, in CoffeeMud, a mob or players
Alignment is implemented as a Faction.&nbsp; The Alignment can be
thought
of as having a tattoo called alignment along with a numeric value
assigned to it.&nbsp; Alignment can also be thought of as the
relationship
between the mob or player, and evilness, goodness, or neutrality.</p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>The faction system in CoffeeMud is a powerful engine for  defining what
         factions exist, how the factions are assigned, how the value of
 factions         rise or fall in value, how value changes are reflected
in other  factions,         and what impact the value of a faction has on
experience  gain, ability       usage,  and ability skill gain.&nbsp; Since
the values  of factions are     available&nbsp;for   use in&nbsp;Properties
such as Prop_WearZapper,   Prop_ReqEntry,    and all other  features which
respect Zapper Masks, factions  can  also potentially     impact  which items
can be used, which rooms can  be entered, the  price   of  goods,  the availability
of Deities, and many  other things as  well.&nbsp;     As an example, the
alignment faction typically&nbsp;impacts   all of  the   things  mentioned
above and more.</p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>Now, as was said before, factions have numeric  values.&nbsp; These values
         can be positive, like 2389473, negative, or even  0.&nbsp; The range
    of   values  which are valid for a given faction are defined by  the
limits     of   the divisions  or Ranges of a faction.&nbsp; </p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>A <strong>Range</strong> is a  numeric division of a faction you have defined.&nbsp;
A Range has a displayable  name, a special code name for use in Zapper Masks,
and of course a low and high  value.&nbsp; A Range can also be tied back
to CoffeeMud's built in "virtue  meter", which allows you to define a Range
as always granting the mob or player  whose faction value falls into that
range goodness, evilness, or  neutrality.&nbsp; The lowest value of the lowest
Range, and the highest value of  the highest Range define the overall limits
of the values of the faction  itself.&nbsp; No player or mob may have a value
for a faction which falls  outside those highest and lowest values of the
highest and lowest  Ranges.&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, ranges are the most
important part of a  faction.</p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>Another important aspect are the range <strong>Change Triggers</strong>.&nbsp;
         One of the ways factions  differ from simple tattoos is that CoffeeMud
      can   manage the rise and fall in the  values of the faction on a given
    mob  or  player automatically.&nbsp; The way  these changes are triggered
    and managed  is first through Change Triggers, which  are applied when
 both   the source  and target of an action have standing or value  in the
 faction,   and when the source and target are different creatures.&nbsp;
 Each Change   Trigger   defines 1) What triggers the change (the Trigger),
 2)  Whether  value is gained  or lost in the faction when the trigger occurs
 (the  Direction),   3) What percentage of the amount of change (after all
 other  modifiers) is  applied to the value (the Amount Factor),&nbsp; 4)
several  miscellanous  flags to define the circumstances under which the
trigger is  applied (the  Flags), and 5) a Zapper mask to determine what
criteria the target  of the  Trigger must meet for this trigger to apply.&nbsp;
The valid Triggers  include:  Murder, Time (a change occurs every 40 seconds
or so), a type of skill  being  used, the domain of a spell being cast, a
flag associated with a skill  being  used, or Add Outsider, which allows
the faction to be added to those who  do not have the faction, so long as
they meet the other requirements.&nbsp;   Valid Directions of change include:
Up, Down, Opposite (opposite direction  of the value of the creature killed
and proportional in value to the distance      between the faction value&nbsp;in
the source and the target), Minimum  (automatically  gains minimum value),
Maximum (automatically gains maximum   value), Add (gains  the faction if
they don't have it -- useful with the  Add  Outsider trigger),  Away (gain
if monsters value for this faction is  lower, lose  if higher),  and Towards
(gain if monsters value for this faction  is higher, lose  if lower).&nbsp;
Valid Flags include: OUTSIDER, which allows  the trigger to  apply even if
the target of the trigger (not the source) does not have standing  in this
faction, SELFOK, which allows the trigger to apply even when the source 
or target are the same person, and JUST100, which overrides  the normal 
modifications of a change (based on experience or other factors)  and uses
100  points as a base amount for the change from this trigger.</p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>Now, lets discuss how to list existing factions:</p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><strong>LIST FACTIONS</strong></p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>The list that is shown with this command reflects the  list of those factions
         which have been loaded into CoffeeMuds memory.&nbsp;  Factions are
  loaded       into memory when their identifiers/filenames are added to
 the  FACTIONS     entry  in your "coffeemud.ini" file.&nbsp; Factions may
also  be  loaded   if  a mob  or player is loaded who has a faction which
has already  been defined.&nbsp;    Creating new factions, as you can now
guess, is a two part  step.&nbsp;  One  step is to add its identifier/filename
to the FACTIONS entry of  your  "coffeemud.ini"  file, after the file has
been created. To create the new   faction identifier/filename,  you must
do the following:</p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><strong>CREATE&nbsp;FACTION  orc_affinity.ini</strong></p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>This command will create a new file in&nbsp;your  CoffeeMud/resources directory
or folder for the new faction.&nbsp; This file  will contain the default
setting for your brand new faction, whose ID  (identifier) will be ORC_AFFINITY.CMVars.&nbsp;
You will now be automatically  taken into the Faction Editor.&nbsp; If you
had wanted simply to modify an  existing faction, you might have entered:</p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><strong>MODIFY FACTION  resources/reputation.ini</strong></p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>The modify command will take you into the editor for an  existing faction,
         regardless of whether it appears on the LIST FACTIONS list, so 
long     as   the  filename/identifier given refers to an existing faction
file.&nbsp;        The Faction editor contains numerous other&nbsp;complex
and interesting      fields  to change, which we will now describe.</p>

 contains   a list        of  flags to determine which skills, spells, chants,
 etc are   being selected         along with the range into which a players
 value in   this faction must    fall        for the ability to be used unimpeded
 and   with full privileges.&nbsp;           Requirements defined by Ability
 Allowances     will typically determine           whether proficiency is

      <p>A quest is designated by a long set of&nbsp;definitions and pseudo-commands
 called a <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">QUEST-SCRIPT</span>. &nbsp;The
 quests are created by an Archon using the <strong>CREATE QUEST</strong>
[SCRIPT]  command from the command line. Where [SCRIPT] is a either a complete
quest  script, where each command line is terminated by a semicolon (;),
or a load  command of the form LOAD=[SCRIPT PATH]. If you enter a complete
quest script,  make sure that any embedded semicolons are escaped like "\;".
&nbsp;An example  of a create script using a load command (the more common
case) is as follows:</p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><strong>CREATE QUEST</strong>  LOAD=quests/murdermystery/murdermystery.quest</p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>All LOAD commands use the resources directory inside your coffeemud
install directory as the default path. &nbsp;Therefore, if you installed
coffeemud in C:\CoffeeMud, the above LOAD command will look for the
file in C:\CoffeeMud\resources\quests\murdermystery\murdermystery.quest.</p>












      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>Quests may be&nbsp;started automatically (autoquests)  from inside the
         quest script by including&nbsp;the SET WAIT and SET INTERVAL  commands,
       or  they&nbsp;may be started manually by using the <strong>MODIFY
QUEST</strong>          [QUEST NAME] command. </p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>Quests can be listed, to see their status, using the  <strong>LIST QUESTS</strong>
         command. </p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>Quests can be removed from the list using the <strong>DESTROY QUEST</strong>
         [QUEST NAME] command.</p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>Quests can be saved using the <strong>SAVE QUESTS</strong> command. Quests
 saved this way will be restored during the next CoffeeMud reboot. &nbsp;Any
 time the CREATE QUEST command is used, you will need to follow it with a
SAVE QUESTS if you want your quest to remain. </p>

purpose of this command is to allow your quest to run in several
different steps or stages. &nbsp;Placing this command in your quest
script will cause the script to end execution when it is encountered.
&nbsp;The quest will run
normally until it is ordered to proceed with the next step using the
Scriptable command MPSTEPQUEST. &nbsp;When the&nbsp;MPSTEPQUEST command
is issued, the quest script will clean up any
objects or data defined by statements prior to this STEP command, and
begin processing new quest script commands which follow it. &nbsp;A SET
DURATION command must follow a STEP command in order to ensure that the
quest will continue to run following execution of the post-STEP
commands, otherwise any duration settings from previous steps will be
re-used. &nbsp;Numerous STEP commands may be places in your quest
scripts. &nbsp;&nbsp;An MPSTOPQUEST command, or an expired duration, however, will always cause the
entire quest to cease executing and all objects to be cleaned up. &nbsp;See also SET PRESERVE. &nbsp;</p>

This command will cause the quest script to stop evaluating any further
settings. &nbsp;Statements after a STEP BREAK, including any SETS,
LOADS, or any other statements, will not be executed. &nbsp; &nbsp;This

such as SET MOBGROUP, SET MOB, SET ITEMGROUP, SET ROOM, etc, have forms which
allow you to designate their value using an [OBJECT] string. &nbsp;An [OBJECT]
string is one of the following basic quest-script values: "LOADEDMOBS", "LOADEDITEMS", 
 "AREA", "ROOM", "MOBGROUP", "ITEMGROUP", "ROOMGROUP", "ITEM", "ENVOBJ", "STUFF",
"MOB", or one of the following mystery quest-script values: &nbsp;"FACTION", 
 "FACTIONGROUP", "AGENT", "AGENTGROUP", "ACTION", "ACTIONGROUP", "TARGET",
 "TARGETGROUP", "MOTIVE", "MOTIVEGROUP", "WHEREHAPPENED", "WHEREHAPPENEDGROUP",
 "WHEREAT", "WHEREATGROUP", "WHENHAPPENED", "WHENHAPPENEDGROUP", "WHENAT",
 "WHENATGROUP", "TOOL", "TOOLGROUP". &nbsp;Using the SET command in this
way  allows you to either COPY an objects value, or re-designate it for the
purposes  of one of the GIVE ... commands. &nbsp;If the quest script was
executed from  inside of another using the LOAD= script command, and arguments
were specified  from the above objects, you may also have access to argument
object specifiers,  such as ARG1, ARG2, ... ARGN. &nbsp;There will be one
such object specifier  available for each argument passed to the script.
&nbsp;Please note that some object specifiers return single objects (such
as MOB, ITEM, ROOM) and some return collections of objects (such as ROOMGROUP,
MOBGROUP, ITEMGROUP). &nbsp;Object specifiers can also be combined using
+ and - characters. &nbsp;For instance, MOBGROUP-MOB would return the group
of mobs in the MOBGROUP minus the specified MOB while the specifier MOB+ITEM
would refer to an object group containing both the specified MOB and the
specified ITEM.</p>

specifing  parameters for the GIVE BEHAVIOR, GIVE ABILITY, or GIVE AFFECT
command, you  may embed the names of one or more of the Object Specifiers
by prefixing the Object Specifier code string with a $ character, and concluding
it with a space or other non-alphanumeric character. &nbsp;For instance,
the command:&nbsp;"GIVE  BEHAVIOR Scriptable GREET_PROG 100\; say I love
$MOB!!!\;~\;" would embed  the name string for the MOB object specifier inside
the in-line script. &nbsp;  In addition to this capability, you may also
put a special character after  the $ and before the object specifier to manipulate
how the name of the object  is generated. &nbsp;Special characters are: '_'
(to make the name in uppercase),  '&amp;' to remove any prefixed english
article words from the name, or '|'  to replace all spaces in the name with
| characters (which is very useful  for QuestChat parameters).</p>

         in CoffeeMud, there are still a few  more details to learn about
JavaScripting         in your quest  scripts.&nbsp;Although</font></span><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: blue;"><font color="#000000" size="3"> Javascript
          does not require semicolon line delimeters and it will not likely
  cause       problems, you should be aware that the&nbsp;quest manager engine
  will   strip    out  all semicolons as part of its command parsing process.&nbsp;
     For this    reason, if  you absolutely must keep a semicolon ANYWHERE
 in   your javascript,    whether as  part of a displayable string, or a
line   delimeter,    it must first   be escaped:  \;</font></span></font></span></p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>The quest manager engine will also make a couple of  useful methods available
         to your Javascript for assisting in setting up your  quests.&nbsp;
  One    is   the <font face="Courier New"><font size="2">Quest quest() </font></font><font face="Times New Roman">method, which, as you can see,  returns a Quest object
         which represents to the current quest script.&nbsp; The  Quest object
     returned    has numerous useful methods on them for doing things like
  determining    which   mobs and items were selected by the SET commands
as described  above   (<font face="Courier New" size="2">isQuestObject, 
getQuestObject,  getQuestMob,      getQuestItem</font>).&nbsp; There are
also methods  for  properly adding    other  such mobs and&nbsp;items to
your quest (<font face="Courier New" size="2">runtimeRegisterObject</font>),
or  for adding&nbsp;abilities,    behaviors,     or effects to existing objects
 (&nbsp;<font face="Courier New" size="2">runtimeRegisterAbility,  runtimeRegisterEffect,
      runtimeRegisterBehavior</font>).&nbsp;    You should  check out the
Quest     interface  for more information on these   methods; they  are located
 in   the file Quest.java,  which is in the com/planet_ink/coffee_mud/interfaces
        package.</font></p>












                     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>Another method provided to Javascript by the quest  manager is the <font face="Courier New" size="2">QuestState  setupState() <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">method.&nbsp;&nbsp;The QuestState object
         made available by  this method contains information on the current
  state      of your quest  Script.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are&nbsp;several
  useful  properties     of the object,  such as <font face="Courier New" size="2">area,  room, mob,     mobGroup, item,</font>
and <font face="Courier New" size="2">envObject</font>     which will refer

      Holidays are a special/reserved quest defined by file /resources/quests/holidays/holidays.quest. <br>

      <br>

They are very simple Scriptless quests that can be started at random
intervals, or on certain mud dates, or&nbsp;real-life dates.&nbsp; The
holidays will only impact the areas specified by the holiday settings,
and only the mobs&nbsp;in those areas specified in the settings, and
only with the features you specify.&nbsp; <br>

      <br>

Use LIST HOLIDAYS to see a&nbsp;list of all defined holidays and the
areas hey are defined for.&nbsp; By default, 3 special-case weather
related&nbsp;holidays are included which impact any area that meets
their special criteria.&nbsp; <br>

      <br>

You can use MODIFY HOLIDAY &lt;name&gt; to&nbsp;change the settings for
a holiday, DESTROY HOLIDAY &lt;name&gt; to delete one, or CREATE
HOLIDAY name to create a new&nbsp;one that will automatically apply to
the area the creator is standing in when it is created.<br>

      <br>

Here are the standard settings for holidays:<br>

 just   needs    hands,    fingers, toes, lips, and other  small body movements,
  while large    movements    require legs, and often moving the  entire
body.   I tend to  not  use the Words   one, and I leave sounds for, well,
 yelling    and such.  This  particular social   involves toes, thus it's
a M)ovement.     Type "<strong>M</strong>"    for that.</p>

to  know you're    performing     a social. This  social involves toe wiggling,
 so I would  recommend  Visual.     If you're curious  about Hands, that

                        This concludes  the social creation process. Enjoy
 creating   your   own   socials,   folks! To modify  an existing social,
purely use  MODIFY  SOCIAL   [NAME] (i.e.   MODIFY SOCIAL BONK,  MODIFY SOCIAL
HIGHFIVE  &lt;T-NAME&gt;)     or even MODIFY   SOCIAL PAT SELF) What this
 does is it goes through the    command list like   you are creating that
particular  social, but with the   information that is  already stored on
it. What you  can do  is just hit ENTER  until you get to  the part of the
social you want  to change and  change it  accordingly.</p>

      <p>Clans serve many purposes in the CoffeeMud engine. &nbsp;They provide
a way for multiple players to own property, conquer areas, and exert control.
  &nbsp;They also provide a means of expressing politics between themselves
  and other groups, or even with each other. &nbsp;Clans can allow ranking
 players to order each other around, to create special magical items, to
keep  a collective treasury, to collect taxes from other players, and to
override  normal PK (playerkill) settings. &nbsp;Clans can be tyrannical,
run by a select few, run by elected members, or run collectively. &nbsp;Clans
can even be used as an alternative means of learning new Classes.<br>

      <p>By default, clans can be created and managed entirely by players. &nbsp;This
  ability can be removed by disabling the several clan creation and management
  commands from the coffeemud.ini file using the DISABLE= field. &nbsp;Regardless,
  there is also an Archon mechanism for creating and managing clans.</p>
