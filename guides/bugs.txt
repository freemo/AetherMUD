GAES still isn't done
When I boot a player, they're still listed according to the website and archon command 'where', but not to 'who'.. Plus, after having done it,t he CPU time is way up.
Just a command that lets players knock on a door, causing the folk inside to hear a 'knonk on the door' or some such. 5 rooms deep indoors if HARD is used.
