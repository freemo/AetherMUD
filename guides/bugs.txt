GAES still isn't done
nightmare's duration needs to be reduced.
SING social needs to be deleted or renamed.
I believe that the Item zapper looks at class level insteadof total level
I believe nightmare shouldn't last as long as it does, and
that you shouldn't be able to cast spells while under it's affects. I was
fighting Poseidon, and he cast nightmare on me.
the DRAGONFIRE spell says the flames flames the enemy when it damages an opponenet. The first flames needs to be singular, so that it says The FLAME flames the enemy.
