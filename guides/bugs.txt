the damage message is broken on Flameshield.  Whenever a royal guard attacks me and takes damage it says the flameshield around you flares up an <DAMAGE> the royal guard.  At the time, I am under the affects of Improved Inv, Mirror image, stoneskin, mage armor, et al. 

the range bug is still there, zara can not cast summon at a range, but she
is not in combat. It occurs when Zara initiates the combat, not theDragon.
