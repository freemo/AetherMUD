<p align="center"><strong><font size="4"><b><span

<p align="left"><strong><b><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font

<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="4"><span
 style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">The&nbsp;fantasy
 engine&nbsp;moderates a&nbsp;game about the accumulation of  personal Power
by the player for his or her game character.&nbsp; Personal power is  typically
measured&nbsp;by combat prowess, but can also be measured by the  breadth
of skills the player accumulates. Since skills are usually intended to  enhance
the players prowess in combat,&nbsp;it becomes evident that, ultimately,
 combat prowess&nbsp;is the&nbsp;measure of the power of the  player.</font></span></span></font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="4"><span
 style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">Combat
 prowess&nbsp;involves the ability to&nbsp;hit foes in combat (attack), the
 ability to damage foes which are hit, the ability&nbsp;to  avoid being hit
by foes in combat (armor), and the ability to withstand  damage done by&nbsp;foes
when hit.&nbsp; Maximizing these abilities is done primarily through  items
of armor, items of weapons, armoring skills, damaging skills, and  improvement
of vital statistics such as health, strength, dexterity, and other  attributes
important to both skills and the long-run development of  other vital statistics.</font></span></span></font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="4"><span
 style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3"><strong>Levels
and  Experience</strong></font></span></span></font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="4"><span
 style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">The
fantasy  players&nbsp;power will tend to remain static  for a period equal
to their time at a given numeric Level of  achievement.&nbsp; Levels are,
therefore, a fair measure of the power of a  player.&nbsp; When levels are
gained or lost, however, power will tend to rise and  fall respectively.&nbsp;
This is due primarily to the fact that the reward of  gaining in the numeric
level of achievement will always take the form of new  skills or attributes
which contribute to the combat prowess, and therefore the power,&nbsp;of
the  player.&nbsp; The player who gains in levels will be instantly granted
 a greater ability to withstand damage done by foes, greater access to skills,
 a greater ability to use their existing skills, and a greater ability to
hit foes  in combat.&nbsp; An advanced level also opens up the player to
the availability  of more powerful items of armor and weaponry.&nbsp; Players
will also,  from time to time, gain new skills automatically&nbsp;by advancing
in&nbsp;level.&nbsp;  Lastly, gaining a level will&nbsp;grant the player&nbsp;tokens
 of credit in the form of Training Points and Practice Sessions,  which can
be spent to improve vital statistics, or to gain new  skills&nbsp;&nbsp;
All of these things amount to the ability to improve the  players power.</font></span></span></font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="4"><span
 style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">Higher
levels  of achievement are awarded in the fantasy game for the accumulation
of a number  of Experience Points sufficient to qualify the player for the
higher  level.&nbsp; Experience points may be gained or, usually&nbsp;through
 carelessness, lost.&nbsp; If a player loses a sufficient number of experience
 points, they may also be demoted to a lower level of  achievement.</font></span></span></font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="4"><span
 style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">Experience
 points, in turn, are gained in many ways.&nbsp; The most common way is through
 the Demonstration of the players combat prowess over the computer-animated
denizens  of the world through combat.&nbsp; A player who defeats a foe in
combat will  gain experience points proportional to the foes own power and
combat  prowess.&nbsp; A player who defeats a weak foe will not be awarded&nbsp;any
 experience points, while defeating an extremely powerful foe will yield
the  greatest experience point  award.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span></span></font></span><span
 style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="4"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">                               
            Experience points may also be gained by the exercise of  the
players non-combat powers, which is discussed in the next  section.&nbsp;</font></span></span></font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">Either
way, experience points, typically  gained through the exercise of combat
prowess through actual combat, are applied  towards the gaining of levels.&nbsp;
The gain in levels is then accompanied by  greater combat prowess, which
allows the player to more easily defeat foes in  combat, and continue the
cycle of gaining personal  power.</font></span></span></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="4"><span
 style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3"><strong>Character
Classes</strong></font></span></span></font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="4"><span
 style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">Variety
being  the spice of life, numerous ways have been devised to vary the ways,
means, and  types of ways in which a player can gain in power.&nbsp; Some
players may wish  to focus primarily on ensuring that they can withstand
the attacks of other  foes, even at the expense of an improved ability to
deal damage.&nbsp; Some  players may wish to focus on developing their power
through items of armor and  weaponry, even at the expense of a better set
of skills.&nbsp; Still other  players may want to focus entirely on skills
as a means of maintaining combat  prowess, even if it means their native&nbsp;combat
prowess is quite weak.&nbsp;  To accomodate these differing philosophies
of play, the game engine affords  players a choice in several Character  Classes</font></span></span></font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="4"><span
 style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">Character
 Classes are divided into several basic types, each of which embodies the
 different philosophies of accumulating and using power.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
basic  types include:</font></span></span></font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="4"><span
 style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">The
Fighter,  with strong native combat prowess, and broad access to items of
armor and  weaponry, but extremely weak in power through  skills.</font></span></span></font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="4"><span
 style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">The
Mage, who  is weakest in native combat ability, and has almost no access
to items of armor  and weaponry, but which has the broadest and most formidible
selection of skills  for doing damage and avoiding the attacks of  foes.</font></span></span></font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="4"><span
 style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">The
Cleric,  who embodies the defensive philosophy, being weak in the ability
to deal damage,  but strong in the ability to withstand and recover from
it.&nbsp; This class  also includes evil clerics, who approach the Mage in
their modus operendi, but  still harbor the general clerical weaknesses of
low attack ability  and&nbsp;stronger armoring abilities.&nbsp; Evil clerics
are most likely to use  their skills to approximate the more direct healing
mechanisms enjoyed by the  Good cleric, which also keeps them under the general
Clerical  umbrella.</font></span></span></font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="4"><span
 style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"></span></span></font></span><span
 style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="4"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">The Bard embodies the philosophy
of  strength in numbers.&nbsp; This class is designed primarily to be attractive
to  groups of other classes, meaning that the bard gains in power by joining
his  strength with others.&nbsp; The bard is natively weak in both attack
and  defensive abilities, but tends to have powerful skills which will tend
to  enhance groups of other players in their own  abilities.</font></span></span></font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="4"><span
 style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">The
Druid,  like the Bard, embodies the philosophy of strength through external
 assistance.&nbsp; In the case of the Bard, this assistance comes from other
 players.&nbsp; For the druid, it comes from other computer-automated creatures
 in the game, whose assistance the Druid can solicit through skills.&nbsp;
This  makes the druid not unlike the evil cleric in some respects, but without
the  evil clerics ability to empower him or herself through items of armor.&nbsp;
 This is made up for in the druid class by an enhanced ability to withstand
 damage dealt by foes through the druids weak  armor.</font></span></span></font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="4"><span
 style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">The
Thief is  both a weak mix of all of the other classes, with moderate access
to items of  armor and weaponry and&nbsp;moderate native defensive abilities,
and moderate  access to combat skills.&nbsp; The strength of the Thief, however,
comes from  unique access to abilities found in no other classes.&nbsp; Thieves
have unique  access to monetary wealth, with which the favors of other players
can be  gained.&nbsp; They also have unique access to the areas of the World
in which  the players live.&nbsp; Unlike the other classes, a thief has mechanisms
to go  to places and to get into things which no other class has.&nbsp; Thieves
also  have the unique ability to pass through the world without being detected,
which  assists in their ability to access the otherwise  inaccessible.</font></span></span></font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="4"><span
 style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">The
Character Classes above  do not only embody certain philosophies in the accumulation
of power.&nbsp; They also  embody certain fantasy arch-types.&nbsp; These
arch-types, made popular  by books such as Lord of the Rings and games such
as Dungeons and Dragons,&nbsp;are  the basis for the most popular forms of
fantasy role-playing.&nbsp; For this reason,  the emersion of the player
into the role that they have selected  becomes an end in itself, and a secondary
goal beyond the primary one of  the accumulation of combat prowess.&nbsp;
To further this goal, certain other means  of gaining experience points by
the use of non-combat skills which are designed  to enhance role-playing,
are devised and put into practice.&nbsp; These alternative  means&nbsp;of
gaining experience through role-playing&nbsp;can include things such as a
Thief stealing, or a  Druid planting trees and communing with nature, or
a Cleric converting infidels  to religion, or a Bard performing for a  crowd.</font></span></span></font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="4"><span
 style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3"><strong>Wrapping
Up</strong></font></span></span></font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="4"><span
 style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">As&nbsp;
was  stated in the overview, the fantasy game is about the accumulation of
personal  power for the players character, usually in the form of combat
prowess.&nbsp;  The mechanisms employed, namely Skills, Levels and Experience
Points, as well as  the restrictions imposed in the form of Character Classes,
forms the basis of  most fantasy Muds.&nbsp; Alternatives have become to
emerge which attempt to  remove the intermediary goals represented by levels,
the measure of progress  represented by experience points, and&nbsp;the restrictions
and role-playing  benefits of character classes.&nbsp; These alternatives
operate in many  different ways, but they all still boil down to the fundamental
game missions of  accumulating personal power, usually combat  prowess.</font></span></span></font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><strong><b><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font
 color="#9400d3" size="4">The Heroics Game</font></span></b></strong></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">The heroics
game will  essentially be an engine whereby classless/leveless players take
on goals  assigned by the system on behalf of a faction.&nbsp; Completing
the goal will  allow the player to gain favor with that faction, and lose
favor with rival  factions.</font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3"><strong>Goals</strong></font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">The most common
goal  for players will be the solving of certain logic problems generated
by the  system, which are based around both engine generated characters,
as well as mobs  already in the game Area.&nbsp; The logic problems, also
called "mysteries",  will take many different forms, depending on the nature
of the faction that  assigns them.</font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">Example goals
for a  "city hall" faction might include: Solving a murder mystery, solving
a robbery,  uncovering corruption.</font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">Solving these
larger  goals will involve the answering of specific questions via the use
of  cluse.&nbsp; Examples of the types of questions one must answer to complete
a  goal might include: WHO knows something, WHO did something, WHO are relatives,
 WHERE did they do something, WHERE are they now, With WHAT did they do  something,
WHO they work for, or are working for.</font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">Answering these
 questions then becomes the basis for the more specific goal-oriented quests
 which must be solved by the players to gain favor with the  faction.</font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">Example of
the use of  specific question-related goals for an "underworld" faction might
include: Who  witnessed one of their crimes? Who has talked to the police
(so you can go  punish them?)&nbsp;What clues did&nbsp;a villain leave behind?
Who is a  heroes leading lady? Who is a heroes family? Where does the leading
lady/family  work/live.&nbsp;What is a heroes secret identity.&nbsp;Who are
the bribable  police, and how much will they take. Who makes the parts you
need for your  secret weapon,&nbsp;or&nbsp;who knows how to make the parts
you need?&nbsp;  </font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">Goals can also
be  complex.&nbsp; For instance, if the underworld wants a secret weapon
built, it  might set up intermediate goals such as:&nbsp; aquiring&nbsp;money
for  protection (who is bribabble?), who makes the parts, who knows how to
make  it.</font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3"><strong>Clues</strong></font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">The answering
of the  questions involved in accomplishing the goals of a faction is accomplished
by  uncovering and logically deducing from information provided by the system
in the  form of clues.</font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">Every mystery
will  begin with a dialog from a faction.&nbsp; The dialog usually involves
telling  the player either what has happened, or what is happening, or perhaps
what needs  to happen.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">The system
will then  generate the appropriate questions which need to be answered in
order to solve  the mystery.&nbsp; From there, the system will generate numerous
acceptable and  possible answers to the questions (suspects for a WHO question,
places for a  WHERE question, items for a WHAT question, etc).&nbsp;&nbsp;
Lastly, the system  will generate clues of various sorts which either help
to answer a question  directly, or answer it indirectly by making all answers
but the correct one  impossible.</font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">Types of clues
 include:&nbsp; </font></span><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font
 size="3">Contaminants (blood stains, mud stains, smells, being wet, being
deaf  because of noise, weather-related), </font></span><span
 style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">Reputation (weapons usually used,
places  usually gone, people usually known, things known to believe, phobias),
Witnesses  (weapons seen with, places seen, people seen with, things heard
said), and  Gotchas (Phobia, Pressure/Confrontation, Being a witness yourself,
Items owned,  Glove that fit, Footprints, fingerprints) </font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">Depending on
the  difficulty level, the system might also generate anti-clues or deceptions
 regarding the true answer.&nbsp; This can include </font></span><span
 style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">disguises&nbsp;to deceive&nbsp;witnesses,
 lies&nbsp;to deceive&nbsp;reputations, item-plants&nbsp;to  deceive&nbsp;contaminants.&nbsp;
What dealing with deceptions, however, the  system will be careful to generate
enough proper and correct clues to overcome  deceptions.&nbsp; For instance,
if a witness is set to lie about an answer, at  least two other witnesses
will give the correct answer to overcome the  lie.&nbsp; A deceptive item
plant will be overcome by at least two other  contaminant clues which point
to the proper answer, and so  forth.</font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">Uncovering
clues will  involve doing things such as: Asking questions of witness mobs,
who will answer  according to what they have been assigned to know and say.&nbsp;
Finding  contaminants by searching or examining items and places, and possibly
performing  gotchas by exposing suspects to objects of their phobias, or
having them try on  a glove.</font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><font size="3">Solving
the  Mystery</font></strong></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">Once the answers
to the  appropriate questions have been uncovered in the allotted time, they
are  delivered to the head of the faction which requested the mystery.&nbsp;
If the  answers are correct, the mystery is solved and an appropriate dialog
is given to  wrap up the mystery.&nbsp; At this point the player is  rewarded.</font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">Rewards will
include:  gaining favor with the faction that assigned the mystery, the assignment
of more  interesting and complex problems from the faction, finding the faction
 more&nbsp;helpful in combat or at least non-hostile, getting better prices
in  faction shops, gaining interesting tecipes for common skills, gaining
henchmen  (for villians, they tank, and are very weak),&nbsp;gaining leading
ladies or  suiters, and gaining sidekicks (they get more powerful, but fewer
of them than  henchmen).</font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">The engine
should  maintain a static state of all area maps, while still keeping a small
level of  realism.&nbsp; For murdered or captured mobs, this should involve
only changing  the names of the affected mobs according to an engine formula.</font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><font size="3">Player
 Interaction</font></strong></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">Each player
that plays  the heroics game will select a superhero with the appropriate
superpowers.&nbsp;  These powers will not be overwhelmingly useful in solving
the mysteries, but may  help with tertiary encounters or with just getting
around the map.&nbsp; The  player will also select a secret identity.&nbsp;
When in this secret identity  form, they are effectively protected harassment
by those in favor of rival  factions, but also gain no benefit from harassing
others themselves.&nbsp;  Players using their secret identity may have an
easier time getting questions  answered from witnesses of rival factions
than they do in their superhero form,  but generally would have more trouble
getting any witness to talk at ALL.&nbsp;  After all, it is intimidating
to be a super hero.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">Players can
play an  active role in each others attempts to solve the mysteries.&nbsp;
When a player  solves a mystery, he is the only one who benefits.&nbsp; However,
when a player  fails to solve a mystery, ALL players in favor with rival
factions  benefit.&nbsp; This means that it is in the benefit of players
to try and thwart  a players attempt to solve a mystery.&nbsp; This may be
done by tampering with  evidence or witnesses, or by harassing the player
directly.&nbsp;  </font></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">Players should
be set  only to go unconscious on death.&nbsp;&nbsp; Players rendered so
by other  players will not only gain favor with factions that rival the defeated
one, but  will lose faction with the defeated players Personal faction, named
after  themselves.&nbsp; Factions of this kind can be used to determine arch
enemies,  and track rival hero information.</font></span></p>

<p align="left"><i><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><font size="3">So much
hingles on a good system for generating mysteries. &nbsp;This last section
is therefore a developers scratchpad for thinking through the proper way
to do that. &nbsp; There are lots of abstraction issues here -- does the
system generate everything? &nbsp;Is it guided entirely or partly by scripts,
and if so, how much so? &nbsp;This all determines basically whether the heroics
system is some minor adjustments to the Quest engine, coupled with LOTS of
configuration files, or whether it's an Enormous Library coded in Java, triggered
simply by the existence of Heroics-areas. &nbsp;With lots of abstraction
stages in between those! &nbsp;As fundamental as this question is, it can
actually be answered last, as its totally implementation. &nbsp;Thinking
through a mystery generation process takes precedence.<br>
