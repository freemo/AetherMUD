<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center><STRONG>By Archon Grothus Gallslanger 
of the&nbsp;Free City of Maltan</STRONG></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Causing buildings and towers to appear along paved 
streets, mountains to rise from the dust, and then breathing life into this 
worlds denizens may seem like a daunting task, but you will quickly discover 
that it is not so.&nbsp; All it takes is some careful planning, and educated 
execution.</P>
<P><STRONG>Planning is the First 
Step</STRONG></P>
<P>Before a single bird can flitter through the skies that 
you opened up, you must have planned the placement of that sky, and the song of 
that bird.&nbsp; I am assuming you have been given some general area to 
construct, some wicked kingdom, joyous elven city by the sea, or some other such 
nonsense.&nbsp; If not, get one; decide on the general theme of some area you 
wish to construct.</P>
<P>At this point I suggest you&nbsp;get a piece of graph 
paper or parchment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon it you shall draw small squares next 
to each other.&nbsp; Plot out every location you will create.&nbsp; The squares 
need not be equal in size, but they need to all fit together somehow.&nbsp; 
Before invoking the spells of creation, you should know where every door leads, 
where every path ends, and if X indeed marks the spot, where the X is.<BR><BR>Inside each square, you shall make 
small notes.&nbsp; What notes?&nbsp; Well, that's the next part of our 
story.</P>
<P><STRONG>Understanding 
Rooms</STRONG></P>
<P>At the foundation of the CoffeeMud world is the 
room.&nbsp; Now, a room is not just some pink wallpapered play area, but simply 
a place.&nbsp; Certainly a kitchen can be a room, as can a pink wallpapered play 
area, but so can the bottom of a well, a stretch of rolling hills, the top of a 
tall mountain, or a dragon’s lair deep underground.&nbsp; Physical size does not 
matter with rooms; only your imagination can determine that.</P>
<P>Every room has a general foundational type that defines 
it.&nbsp; That type determines the behavior of that room day to day, whether it 
is outside or inside, made of wood or stone, a mountain or a plain, in darkness 
or light, a cliffside or deep in the ocean.&nbsp; This foundational type of 
every room has a name: Locale.&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you log into CoffeeMud right now, you can list the 
available Locales with the command "list locales".&nbsp; This list should 
include many different types of locales, most of which are 
self-explanatory.&nbsp; They include:</P>

<P><BR>For each room you are drawing 
on your graph parchment, you should note in the Locale type of the room from the 
above list, or from the list you received when you entered "list locales" into 
CoffeeMud.</P>
<P>The detailed properties of rooms are discussed further 
in the section on creating rooms.</P>
<P><STRONG>Understanding 
Exits</STRONG></P>
<P>Now surely you did not expect everyone to conjure him or 
herself from place to place!&nbsp; Why, the pitiful halfling thieves would 
starve in their holes if this were so.&nbsp; No, each of the rooms you have 
drawn on your paper will be connected with things called Exits.</P>
<P>For any two rooms that one can travel between, there are 
always two exits.&nbsp; One exit leads from the first room to the second. 
Another exit leads from the second room to the first.&nbsp; Usually those exits 
are the same, but they need not be if you don't want them to be so.</P>
<P>All exits will take a person from one room to another, 
and may even take them back again if you choose.&nbsp; An exit can only be 
located in one of six directions: North, South, East, West, Up, and Down.&nbsp; 
The four compass directions are easy to fathom, but be careful with up and down, 
as they need not be unhindered flight, or a reckless fall.&nbsp; If, for 
instance, the destination room is a Locale like "InTheAir", then Up obviously 
represents the open sky.&nbsp; If it is another "StoneRoom", however, it 
probably represents a flight of stairs.&nbsp; The Down direction may represent 
falling off a cliff, but it may also represent a ladder down to the 
basement.&nbsp; Either way is fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Exits, like rooms, can be of many different types.&nbsp; 
If you are still in CoffeeMud, enter the command "list exits".&nbsp; The list 
you receive describes the many connectors that can be mixed and matched between 
rooms.&nbsp; Some include doors, and some include doors with locks.&nbsp; There 
are walkways with pits, doors with needle traps, and many others.&nbsp; By far 
the most common of these Exits is called "Open".&nbsp; It describes a completely 
free and clear path between the two rooms you are creating.&nbsp; Here is the 
official list:</P>

<P>As you finish your graph parchment drawing, be sure to 
note those places where there are doors, locked doors, pit traps, and open 
walkways.&nbsp; If a door is one way, or if a door leads to one place when one 
enters, but does not go back to there when one leaves, make a note of that 
too.</P>
<P>However, it may come to pass that there is a rickety 
straw door to some hut you wish to have, but it was not listed among your 
choices.&nbsp; Fear not, for there is "GenExit".&nbsp; "GenExit" stands for 
"Generic Exit", and represents the finest in Archon power.&nbsp; A completely 
customizable exit flowing from one room to another.&nbsp; GenExits, as well as 
the other features of exits, are discussed further in the section on creating 
exits.</P>
<P><BR><STRONG>Understanding That Which Creepeth Upon the 
Land</STRONG></P>
<P>The denizens of your land are surely the greatest 
accomplishment you will claim.&nbsp; From the lowly cooks in your kitchens to 
the great beasts in the darkest dungeons, it is they who will be remembered by 
those who visit your realm.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Funny then that for things so important, they should 
have such a short, ugly sounding name: MOB.&nbsp; If you are in CoffeeMud, you 
can list them: "list mobs".&nbsp; It will show you every creature that can 
populate your cities, dwell in your dungeons, or hide in your pantries.&nbsp; 
They are too numerous to list here. </P>
<P>If a creature is not listed there that you require, 
there is always the GenMob, that nasty formless being that can be shaped by the 
Archon to appear and behave exactly as it should.&nbsp; A GenShopkeeper is also 
available to provide valuable services for your community.&nbsp; GenDeitys give 
your Clerics employment. GenRideable mobs provide transport.&nbsp; For more 
devious spirits, however, the GenUndead is also available, to strike fear in the 
hearts of the purest cleric.</P>
<P>GenMobs, as well as the features of MOBs, are discussed 
further in the section on creating MOBs.</P>
<P><STRONG>The Things We 
Treasure</STRONG></P>
<P>Our last planning topic is that of the items that will 
be found in your land.&nbsp; Some of them will be priceless once-in-a-lifetime 
creations.&nbsp; Others will be reoccurring trapped chests that always seem to 
have enough gold for those bold enough to continuously risk their guardians.</P>
<P>The items can be discovered using the "list items" 
command.&nbsp; Other items include weapons, which can be discovered through 
"list weapons", armor from "list armor", and other miscellaneous enchanted items 
through "list magic".&nbsp; </P>
<P>For those items you need by are not present, there is 
also the "GenItem",&nbsp;"GenBoat", "GenChair", "GenBed", "GenCoins", 
"GenCorpse", "GenKey", "GenLantern", "GenLightSource", 
"GenMap",&nbsp;&nbsp;"GenRideable", "GenWallpaper", "GenJournal", 
"GenContainer", "GenFood", "GenWater", and "GenReadable".&nbsp; For the fighting 
spirit there is the "GenWeapon", "GenStaff", and "GenArmor".&nbsp; Among 
the&nbsp;formless magical items are "GenPill", "GenPotion", "GenScroll", 
"GenWand", and "GenSuperPill".&nbsp; These and the many properties of items are 
discussed below under the section on creating items.</P>
<P><STRONG>The Art of 
Creation</STRONG></P>
<P>Before beginning, you should log into CoffeeMud and take 
yourself to some place that is adjacent to the area you will be forming.&nbsp; 
You should also cast the spell of natural enlightenment using the following 
command: "sysmsgs".&nbsp; You should see an utterance that reads "Extended 
messages are now: ON".&nbsp; </P>
<P>Now your eyes will behold new wonders when you look 
around the rooms:&nbsp; You will see the Locale types of the room, the Room IDs 
that have been assigned uniquely to each room, the Area IDs of the area you are 
in.&nbsp; They should look like this:</P>
<P>Area&nbsp; :(MyArea)<BR>Locale: 
(StoneRoom)&nbsp; <BR>(MyArea#123) Joe Bob's Room</P>
<P>The first line lists the area name, the second line the 
locale type we talked about earlier, and the&nbsp;third line lists the Room ID, 
followed by the Room Name.&nbsp; Take note of them all, my friend, and learn to 
appreciate their beauty.&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG>Creating Rooms</STRONG></P>
<P>Now that you have your plan laid out, it is quite time 
to being execution.&nbsp; Gather your strength, and begin harnessing the power 
of the Archon, for you will need every ounce of it when the wood and rock chips 
start flying.</P>
<P>To create a new room most easily, you must first be 
standing in&nbsp;a room adjacent to it,&nbsp;one that will be connected to it 
through some exit.&nbsp; You will then utter the invocation of room creation, 
summoning the Locale in the direction that the new room should be.&nbsp; For 
instance, you wish to have a new room&nbsp;north of room "MyArea#123".&nbsp; If 
room&nbsp;"MyArea#123” is already created, and the new room&nbsp;is going to be 
of the "StoneRoom" Locale, you would bring yourself to room&nbsp;"MyArea#123" 
and utter the words:&nbsp; "create stoneroom north".</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/createroom.gif" ></P>
<P>At this point, you should cover your ears, as the sound 
of a stone room falling to the north is often quite disturbing.&nbsp; Between 
the two rooms; the one you are standing in, and the one you have created, will 
be a default exit: the Open exit.&nbsp; Most times, that is ok, though changing 
it will be the subject of the next section.</P>
<P>However, once this is done, and the rooms are 
irrevocably linked, you can still throw a small twist on things.&nbsp; If you 
are still standing in room "MyArea#123" and wish to create a NEW StoneRoom in 
the SAME direction, it can be done.&nbsp; Uttering the words "create StoneRoom 
north" AGAIN and a new room is created.&nbsp; Now, what happened with 
"MyArea#124" you’re wondering?&nbsp; It is still there, and it still leads back 
to where you are standing -- a one way exit.</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/createroom2.gif" ></P>
<P><STRONG>Creating and Modifying 
Areas </STRONG></P>
<P>A town or village, country or demesnes can hardly come 
to be without the careful demarcation of their borders.&nbsp; What seperates the 
town from the country, or one country from another?&nbsp; Like everything else, 
this is the decision of the Archon as he groups his rooms into Areas.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The best way to create your areas is to do so right from 
the start.&nbsp; The moment you create the first plot of land in your new area, 
or lay down the first building in your new town, you should designate it as 
such.&nbsp; Enter the new room in your new area and utter the mystic chant 
"modify room area New Area Name".&nbsp; Of course, where "New Area Name" can be 
anything you wish.&nbsp; Call it "Newarea Land" or "Goldfish Villiage" or "The 
Fruity Phantasm" or whatever strikes your fancy.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Now that you have designated your new room as belonging 
to a new area, it is important to remember to create all future rooms 
by&nbsp;doing so from&nbsp;rooms that already belong to the new area.&nbsp; Any 
future rooms that you build by standing in your new area room will bear its area 
mark, as well as any rooms created from any other room bearing the new area 
mark.&nbsp; If you fail then, you may be forced to invoke the power of the 
"modify room area..." command again to re-group the rooms you are creating.<BR><BR>Areas also contain important 
properties which may be modified.&nbsp; Enter the secret code "modify area" to 
go through a list of these modifiable properties.&nbsp; The name and description 
of the area may be changed by following the promptings.&nbsp; You may also 
tinker with the climate of your area, which will affect the types of weather 
that will blow through it, and how mild or severe the winters and summers may 
be.&nbsp; You will also be asked to add any "behaviors" and "affects" to 
the&nbsp;area that you wish to.&nbsp; These may seem strange at first, and 
usually you won't add any of these at all.&nbsp; After all, rarely does a plot 
of dirt exibit any behavior, and what the heck is an affect?&nbsp; Well! To the 
first, the wind blowing through the trees, the hoot of an owl, or a distant 
cackling noise are all considerable behaviors.&nbsp; In fact, it is a behavior 
called "Emoter".&nbsp; Enter "ahelp emoter" for more information about the 
Emoter behavior.&nbsp; As for affects, well, affects are special properties 
which you can attach to your new little holes in the ground.&nbsp; There are 
lots of nice properties that one may add to an&nbsp;Area, which will affect 
every room in it, such as "Prop_ReqNoMOB" to make your area a player-only place 
to be.&nbsp; There is also "Prop_MagicFreedom" to fluster any spell-using folks 
that happen along, or "Prop_NoChannel" for a place of quiet... you'll need 
"Prop_PeaceMaker" to go with it if you want peace AND quiet.&nbsp; To learn more 
about the properties you can add to areas and rooms, enter "ahelp" while you are 
in CoffeeMud.&nbsp; Now, isn't this fun?&nbsp; Remember, if you make a mistake, 
fear not, for the land does not grow weary of your molding.&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG>Modifying 
Rooms</STRONG></P>
<P>For now, once you have created a new room, it is time to 
design the landscape of it.&nbsp; To do this, you should enter the room through 
the default Open exit that was created for you.&nbsp; You will find the room 
plain and boring.&nbsp; </P>
<P>To give the room a new name and description, utter the 
invocation: "modify room" and follow the promptings.&nbsp; Like the area above, 
rooms may have behaviors and affects added to them.&nbsp; In this case, the 
behaviors and affects will only be active for this particular room. </P>
<P>If you are ever wandering around, and wish to go 
directly to a room you have created, you may utter the magic matra "goto 
RoomID".&nbsp; For instance, entering "goto MyArea#123" would take you to the 
room we created above.&nbsp; This will especially come in handy when we begin to 
create and destroy the links between rooms, and there is no other way to get to 
a room.</P>
<P><STRONG>Linking Two Rooms 
Together</STRONG></P>
<P>Now that&nbsp;you have created a room, and wish to link 
one of the rooms in your area with one of another, you can use a command that 
utilizes the Room IDs mentioned above.&nbsp; If you would like to create a 
northerly link from room "MyArea#123" to a room whose room ID is "MyArea#124", 
then you need only stand in room "MyArea#123" (use the "goto" command if you 
must), and utter the invocation:&nbsp; "link MyArea#124 north".&nbsp; This will 
create an Open exit between the room you are standing in, and the room whose ID 
is born out.&nbsp; </P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/linkroom.gif" ></P>
<P>You should note that this command could be used as it 
was in the last section to create one-way exits to existing rooms.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>Unlinking Two 
Rooms</STRONG></P>
<P>If you wish to detach two rooms from each other, you 
need only learn the "unlink" command.&nbsp; If you are standing in the room to 
the south of the one you wish to unlink, and the room you wish to detach from is 
to the north, utter the command: "unlink north".&nbsp; It will do the trick!</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/destroyroom.gif" ></P>
<P>Keep in mind that just because there is no longer a 
route from the room you are in to the other via a northerly path, it does not 
mean that there is no path from the detached room back to here again.&nbsp; You 
may have to conjure yourself into the&nbsp;other place and enter a "unlink 
south" command to completely detach them forever.</P>
<P><STRONG>Destroying a 
Room</STRONG></P>
<P>Sometimes the pain born from a failed or evil place is 
too much to bear, and as an Archon, you can do something about it.&nbsp; This 
involves the destroy command.&nbsp; It does not merely unlink the room, but 
obliterates it altogether and forever.&nbsp; To do this, first make sure you are 
not standing in the room you wish to destroy.&nbsp; Such destructive magic would 
surely be your end as well.&nbsp; Then you must utilize the Room ID of the 
doomed place.&nbsp; If the room you wish to destroy has the Room ID of 
"MyArea#124", then enter:&nbsp; "destroy MyArea#124".&nbsp; It will obliterate 
that place from the planet forever.</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/destroyroom2.gif" ></P>
<P><STRONG>Creating Exits</STRONG></P>
<P>The difference between Exits and Rooms is a very 
important one.&nbsp; Creating and destroying Rooms describes <EM>WHETHER</EM> two rooms are connected, and by which 
direction.&nbsp; Creating and destroying Exits describes <EM>HOW</EM> one gets from one room to the next.&nbsp; Two 
rooms must be connected together before exits between them can be modified.</P>
<P>For instance, suppose you linked "MyArea#123" and 
"MyArea#124" as described above.&nbsp; By default, you get an StdOpenDoorway, 
also known as an "Open" exit.&nbsp; These exits can be walked through 
freely.&nbsp; Now suppose you wish to have a Door between the two rooms.&nbsp; 
If the exits between the two rooms are both the same, and you are standing in 
the southernmost room of the two, then changing them both is simply a matter of 
issuing the command "create Door north".</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/createexit.gif" ></P>
<P><STRONG>Destroying 
Exits</STRONG></P>
<P>Just as unlinking rooms disconnects them, destroying 
exits can SEEM to disconnect them.&nbsp; When you issue a simple destroy 
command, and refer specifically to the exit, then you will not be destroying the 
link between the two rooms, but merely the exit that travels between them.&nbsp; 
Archons can still travel through these missing links, but players will not be 
able to.&nbsp; Also, destroying an exit only deletes the exit in one direction, 
not both.&nbsp; For instance, if you are standing in the southerly room of two 
linked rooms that both have Exits between them, and you issue the command 
"destroy exit north", you will destroy the Open exit between the rooms.&nbsp; As 
an Archon, you can still travel north through the destroyed exit, but players 
will not be able to.</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/destroyexit.gif" ></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Now, that an exit has been deleted, it is possible to 
create a DIFFERENT kind of exit for the northerly direction from MyArea#123 to 
MyArea#124.&nbsp; Issuing a create command like "create Door north" will create 
a door that leads from MyArea#123 to MyArea#124, WITHOUT AFFECTING the Open path 
from MyArea#124 to MyArea#123.&nbsp; This is only possible when the exits 
between two rooms are different, or one is deleted, as is our case here.</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/destroyexit3.gif" ></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Now, suppose you wanted to have the same Door going 
between two rooms.&nbsp; For sure this is a more common scenario than the 
example we just went through.&nbsp; To do this, you must first delete BOTH of 
the exits between two rooms as described above. That means entering MyArea#123 
and entering "destroy exit north", and then entering MyArea#124 and entering 
"destroy exit south".&nbsp; </P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/destroyexit2.gif" ></P>
<P>Now, with both exits deleted (and thus the same), you 
can create a single door between them as we did in the first part of this 
section using the "create Door south" command.</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/createexit2.gif" ></P>
<P><STRONG>The "GenExit"</STRONG></P>
<P>As mentioned briefly earlier, the GenExit is an 
undefined exit that one can mold to fit ones needs.&nbsp; Whenever a GenExit is 
created or modified, you will be presented with a series of properties to 
change.&nbsp; Hitting return will leave most of these&nbsp;properties without 
modification.&nbsp; Entering new values will replace the old values.&nbsp; These 
properties include:</P>

      the room, rejuvenates or resets to its proper state.&nbsp; The value 
      '2147483647' or '0'&nbsp;means that the item never rejuvenates, but once 
      picked up and brought out of the room, is gone forever.&nbsp; Any other

destruction permanent.</P>
<P><STRONG>Creating MOBs</STRONG></P>
<P>Greater even than the mages powerful spells of summoning

  <TR>
    <TD><EM>Hit Points/Level</EM></TD>
    <TD>this is a multiplier used to determine the 
      creatures hit points.&nbsp; The number 10 is a typical, it is the default, 
      and unless the creature is really nasty (10-20 range), it should be kept 
      at default.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><EM>Alignment </EM></TD>
    <TD>aside from the creatures experience level, this 
      is the most important determinate of whether a player gets experience for 
      killing it.&nbsp; You should make the alignment reflect the creature’s 
      obvious disposition.&nbsp; Making children evil, or a good orc doesn't do 
      anyone any good.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><EM>Money</EM></TD>
    <TD>unless a thief gets it first, this will be the 
      amount of money the creature is carrying.&nbsp; At first level, the number 
      10 is plenty.&nbsp; Again, follow the default.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><EM>Weight </EM></TD>
    <TD>this is only important in determining whether it 
      can be WHOMPed by a fighter.&nbsp; You should make this number reflect the

<P>ShopKeepers are folks that buy and sell equipement that 
is given to them by Archons.&nbsp; Whenever a GenShopKeeper is created, much

in.&nbsp; Pressing enter will leave the property unchanged.&nbsp; The properties

    <TD>a shopkeeper can sell Anything, General items, 
      Armor, Miscellanous magic items not included amongst armor or weapons, 
      Weapons, Pets, Leather items, Only buys the things he also sells (but 
      sells whatever you give him to sell), Trains players in spells, prayers, 
      skills, or songs, Casts prayers, spells, or songs on the buyer, Potions, 
      Land, and more!&nbsp; All shopkeepers can also buy what they sell, 
      excluding Trainers and Casters.</TD></TR>

    <TD>
      <P>This complicated field is where you can adjust the 
      prices the ShopKeeper sells from the programmed normal.&nbsp; An 
      unspecified value here will always return a value of 1.0 (which means NO 
      adjustment).&nbsp; However, you may enter one or more adjustments 
      seperated by semicolons (;).&nbsp; Here is an example:</P>
      <P><FONT face="Courier New" size=2 
      >SELL=5.5 Elf Dwarf ; BUY=0.4 Elf Dwarf ; SELL=1.0 ; 
      BUY=1.0</FONT></P>
      <P>Each adjustment must begin with the words "SELL=" 
      or "BUY=" followed by a Real number designating the adjustment from 
      normal.&nbsp; A value above 1.0 will raise prices.&nbsp; A value below 1.0 
      (like 0.3 or 0.75) will lower prices.&nbsp; Values of 0.0 are NOT 
      allowed.&nbsp; If you need to all but not allow buying and selling, a 
      value of 0.000000001 should do.&nbsp; </P>
      <P>Each adjustment may also contain the name of one 
      or more Racial Categories (Elf, Dwarf, Gnome, Halfing, etc..).&nbsp; If a 
      Racial Category is specified, then the adjustment will ONLY apply to that 
      race.&nbsp; The adjustments are read from left to right, so adjustments 
      without any racial categories should be listed LAST.&nbsp; In the above 
      example, Dwarves and Elves are given a very bad deal, where everyone else 
      gets a normal one.&nbsp; In addition to Racial Categories, you may also 
      list alignments (good, neutral, or evil).&nbsp; Remember that this field 
      is evaluated from left to right, so any matches made&nbsp;on the left that 
      apply to a player will cancel evaluation of the rest of the 
      field!&nbsp;&nbsp; </P></TD></TR></TABLE></STRONG><BR></P><STRONG>

    <TD>This number represents an adjustment to the base

      color.&nbsp; For others, it may bring a slightly different

    <TD>This number represents the number of ticks (4

      '0'&nbsp;means that the&nbsp;MOB never rejuvenates, but once killed, is 
      gone forever.&nbsp; Any other value will represent a number of 
      ticks.&nbsp; This property does not take effect until the room is 
      saved.&nbsp; For more information on making the RejuvTicks property take 
      effect after changing it, see below under Rejuvenating Items and Mobs" or

<P><STRONG>Destroying MOBs</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>To destroy a MOB&nbsp;that is in the same room as you, 
you need only issue the destroy command.&nbsp;&nbsp;MOBs that have been set to 
rejuv will not do so.&nbsp; If the&nbsp;MOB was a permanently saved&nbsp;MOB in 
the room, you must re-save the room in order to make the MOBs destruction 
permanent.</P>
<P><STRONG>Equipping MOBs</STRONG></P>
<P>You may give a MOB equipment to wear or carry as 
treasure, if this is done properly.&nbsp; First off, you can ONLY equip a 
Generic MOB.&nbsp; This includes the GenMob, GenUndead, and GenShopKeeper.&nbsp; 
No other creature may be saved with equipment.&nbsp; Generic or non-Generic 
Items may be used as equipment.&nbsp; To equip the MOB, first create the items 
you wish to give to your new creature using the procedure described above under 
"Creating Items".&nbsp; Now, you may use the Archon "possess" skill to take 
temporary control of your monster, allowing them to pick up the items you 
created and wear or wield them as necessary.&nbsp; Another way is to "order" the 
mob to pick up the items you created, and then "order" them again to wear or 
wield the items.&nbsp; Either way will accomplish the purpose.<BR><BR><STRONG>Practical Affects, MOB Behaviors<BR><BR></STRONG>Although there are 
exceptions, MOBs will be the primary beneficiary of Behaviors (see above under 
Creating MOBs), and Items (and occasionally Rooms) will benefit from 
Affects.&nbsp; Some of the useful Affects for Rooms are already described above 
under Creating Rooms.&nbsp; For Generic Items, Prop_HaveAdjuster, 
Prop_WearAdjuster, Prop_HaveZapper and others are commonly used.&nbsp; For 
Generic MOBs, you will find many useful Behaviors which will add great depth to 
your MUD.&nbsp; The MudChat behavior may be added to ANY Mob to add an extra 
dimension. "Aggressive", "MOBTeacher", and "Mobile" are also extremely common 
behaviors to give to your MOBs.&nbsp; It is highly recommended that any Archon 
wishing to create a rich and wonderous universe spend time perusing the help 
files to learn of the wonders of the Behaviors and Affects.<BR><BR><STRONG>"Rejuvenating Items and Mobs" or "How to Save a 
Room"</STRONG></P>
<P>MOBs and Items that are created in rooms, even those 
which have had the Rejuv Ticks property set to some reasonable number, will not 
actually begin to rejuvenate, and will not reappear in the room when CoffeeMud 
is rebooted, until the room is saved.&nbsp; To save a room, you must be standing 
in it.&nbsp; From there, you may issue either the "save items" command to reset 
the items in the room, "save mobs" command to reset the mobs in the room, or 
"save room" to reset them both.&nbsp; You should make sure that the items, mobs, 
or both, are exactly the way you want them to be when the system is 
rebooted.&nbsp; Players in the room, including yourself and your followers, will 
be ignored by the command to save the mobs.</P>
