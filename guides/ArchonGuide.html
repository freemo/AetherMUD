<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><strong>By Archon Grothus Gallslanger
    of the&nbsp;Free City of Maltan</strong></p>

<p><strong><a name="construct"><strong><font color="royalblue" size="5">World 
   Construction and Destruction</font> </strong></a>   </strong></p>
               
<p>Causing buildings and towers to appear along paved streets, mountains to
rise from the dust, and then breathing life into this worlds denizens may
seem like a daunting task, but you will quickly discover that it is not so.&nbsp;
All it takes is some careful planning, and educated execution.</p>
               
<p>Towards that end, but before we get started properly on the business of
    molding a universe, we must needs take a moment to reflect on the powers 
   of the Archon, and how the universes underlying laws are navigated.&nbsp; 
   Herein, therefore, I have copied from the sacred scrolls the archaic and 
  confusing runes of "CoffeeMud Administration" for your consideration.</p>
               
<p align="left"><strong><font color="red" size="5"><a name="admin">CoffeeMud 
   Administration</a></font> </strong></p>
               
<p align="left">       The administration of your CoffeeMud server is done 
   from within the game server itself, when you are logged in as your Archon 
   player.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some functions can be performed from the <a
 href="MUDGrinder.html">MUDGrinder</a>.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>AHELP<br>
       </em>This is the command that Archons will use to get help on all
of  the   commands in this section, on various administrative topics, and
on all of   the various building "tools" discussed elsewhere in this document, 
including   such things as behaviors and properties.&nbsp; The atopics command 
can give   you a comprehensive list of all the topics you can get help on 
with ahelp.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>ANNOUNCE<br>
       </em>If there is some message you wish to give to everyone presently 
 on  your mud, this is the surest way to make sure they receive it.</p>
               
<p><em>AFTER<br>
       </em>This command lets  the Archon do things after an elapsed time,
 or  even  periodically.</p>
               
<p><em>AS<br>
       </em>This command lets the Archon do anything as another  player.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>AT<br>
       </em>This command lets the Archon  do anything anywhere, regardless
 of  where  he is!</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>BAN<br>
       </em>Deadly, but necessary, this command allows you to specify player
  names,  or partial player names, or IP addresses or IP ranges that you
wish   to keep  OUT of your mud.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>BEACON<br>
       </em>The beacon command is used to change the unique home, start room, 
  or  recall room of either the Archon, or some targeted player.&nbsp; Rarely 
  used,  it is typically invoked only as reward for&nbsp;a player or perhaps 
  a lesser  admin.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>BOOT<br>
       </em>If a player becomes troublesome, or you just want them to go
away,    you will use this power to knock them temporarily out of your mud,
regardless    of where they are in your world.&nbsp; To make them STAY away,
you will  have  to investigate commands such as destroy or ban.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>CHARGEN<br>
       </em>This little tool accepts a character class  name and a level, 
and   it  shows you the stats of an "average" player of that  class and level.&nbsp; 
   Although it's not a vital administration tool, CharGen  can be a helpful 
  aid in the construction of monsters, perhaps.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>CLOAK<br>
       </em>This command makes the player unlisted in  commands like who, 
chanwho,    and on web player lists.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>COPY<br>
       </em>Depending on the argument, this command can make  copies of almost
   anything in your mud, from rooms to monsters and items.&nbsp;  The thing
  you want to copy must exist somewhere in the world for you to properly
 copy  it.&nbsp; You can even specify how many things you wish to copy, for
those   moments when one pot pie just won't do.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>CREATE<br>
       </em>Depending on the argument, this command can bring  almost anything
   into existence, from rooms to doors, from monsters to  items.&nbsp; The
 create  command is discussed at length in the sections on  building rooms
 and areas.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>DESTROY<br>
       </em>This powerful command can be used to banish objects  and mobs,
 rooms   and areas, or even players -- permanently.&nbsp;A&nbsp; player 
(user)  need   not be online to be destroyed. The destroy command, as it
relates to  rooms,   exits, items, and mobs,&nbsp;is discussed&nbsp;further
in the sections on    building rooms and areas. </p>
               
<p align="left"><em>DEVIATIONS<br>
       </em>Can show you the difference between your  world as it is compared 
  with  the standards at the end of this document.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>DRESS<br>
       </em>The quick way to get clothing, weapons  and&nbsp;armor on your
 mobs   from the command line.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>DUMPFILE<br>
       </em>When you want to view some text file on  your&nbsp;computer through 
   the MUD.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>EXPORT<br>
       </em>If you need a backup to your database, you can save  your areas 
 one   at a time as files, for reimportation in the event of a  disaster.&nbsp; 
  This command will generate files with the extension  .cmare.&nbsp; They 
are  XML formatted text files containing all the data you told  the system 
to export.&nbsp; In addition to rooms and areas, you can also  specifically 
export players, some items or mobs from a room.&nbsp; The import  command 
could then be used later to load the data you exported back in.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>GMODIFY<br>
       </em>Quickly search for all the monsters, items, or  rooms that match
  your  search criteria.&nbsp; You can also optionally modify the  found
fields   with  this command.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>GOTO<br>
       </em>Allows the Archon to zap him or herself directly to  the room 
or  mob  of his or her choice.&nbsp; The argument is a valid Room ID,  room
 name,  mob name, or area name.&nbsp; You will find yourself using the goto
  command  quite a bit.&nbsp; Walking everywhere sucks.</p>
               
<p><em>I3<br>
       </em> This module is used  to manage InterMud 3&nbsp;chatting channels.&nbsp; 
   I3 is a component of CoffeeMud that  provides for chatting channels which 
   span across many many muds in cyperspace,  allowing players and admins 
to   talk to folks playing on other muds.</p>
               
<p><em>IMC2<br>
       </em>This module is used to manage InterMud&nbsp;Chat  2&nbsp;information.&nbsp; 
   IMC2 is a component of CoffeeMud that provides for  chatting channels which
   span across many many muds in cyperspace, allowing  players and admins
to   talk to folks playing on other muds.</p>
               
<p>                                            <em>JRUN<br>
       </em>This command can be  used to execute Javascript scripts located 
 on  the local hard drive.&nbsp; If the  gods have given you this power, they
 have great trust in you indeed.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>IMPORT<br>
       </em>Import will suck in one or  more data files and recreate rooms, 
 areas,   players, mobs, items, and lots of  other stuff from the contents 
 of those   files.&nbsp;&nbsp;The data files that  import will successfully 
 read&nbsp;include   (of course) the CoffeeMud .cmare  files discussed under 
 the export command.&nbsp;&nbsp;In   addition,  import&nbsp;will also take 
 in area data&nbsp;files from other  MUDs, such as ROM,  CircleMUD, and others.&nbsp; 
 Of the non-CoffeeMud area  files, the ROM format is  by far the best supported.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>LINK<br>
       </em>This command will cause two places to come together,  making
travel    between them much easier.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>LIST<br>
       </em>The Archon is able to list lots of different things,  for many
 different   reasons.&nbsp; "list users" will show you all of the players,
  and when they  logged on last.&nbsp; This is useful for weeding out olde
 players  (see DESTROY  below).&nbsp;&nbsp;"list threads" will show you how
 many Java  threads are  active.&nbsp; "list ticks" will show you all the
objects making use  of those  threads! "list reports" will&nbsp;show you
your resource usage.&nbsp;   "list  staff" will show you a list of your areas
and any Area staff defined  for  them. You may also list things like locales,
items, weapons, armor, mobs,  and  other things discussed further down in
the sections on world building.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>LOAD<br>
       </em>This command will cause a text or file resource to be  brought
 into   memory.&nbsp; What happens to it from there is your business.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>MERGE<br>
       </em>This powerful tool is rarely used, but is vital if you  need
to  make   small changes to&nbsp;identical items or mobs scattered all around 
  your  world.&nbsp; It uses item or mob data gathered from the&nbsp;export 
 command   to merge with the&nbsp;items and mobs you specify in the real world,
 making  the  necessary world corrections&nbsp;&nbsp;that you want it to.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>MODIFY<br>
       </em>If something which exists is not quite right, this  command can 
 make   it right.&nbsp; By telling the system exactly what you want to  modify, 
 you  can change it into what it ought to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The modify 
  command  is discussed&nbsp;further in the sections on building rooms and 
  areas.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>MULTIWATCH<br>
       </em>A little tool which allows an Archon to gather  evidence against
  multiplaying  players.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>NOPURGE<br>
       </em>Prevent a player from ever being auto-purged  due to not logging
  in.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>ORDER<br>
       </em>Although any player may order around their followers,  an Archon
  can  order ANYONE to do ANYTHING.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>POOF<br>
       </em>This command lets you modify the messages seen when  you use
GOTO   to  move from room to room.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>POSSESS<br>
       </em>Easily the most fun part of being an Archon is to  possess one
 of  the  monsters and harass the players, making them think the  monsters
 have  truely  come to life!&nbsp; Some enjoy this so much that they  forget
 to return to  their true bodies!</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>PURGE<br>
       </em>A moderate form of the DESTROY command which allows  you to clear 
  out  mobs or items without affecting whether or not they will  repopulate 
  (rejuv)  later on.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>RESET<br>
       </em>Giving a parameter of "room" or "area", this command  will make 
 everything   reset back to the state it was last saved at.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>RESTRING<br>
       </em>A moderate form of the MODIFY command which allows  only editing
  a  few fields on items.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>SAVE<br>
       </em>This command is used to update your CoffeeMud  database. If you 
 use   "save user",&nbsp;the system will&nbsp;update the players  data.&nbsp; 
 "save   room" can make aspects of&nbsp;a room permanent by saving it  to 
the database.&nbsp;   Saving rooms is discussed further below in the section 
on  building.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>SESSIONS<br>
       </em>This command will list all of the players online, and  perhaps
 a  few  who are on their way to being online.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>SHELL<br>
       </em>This command will allow you to view the files in your  coffeemud
  folder,  copy and delete files, and even put them in your database.&nbsp;
  Saving files   in the database?&nbsp; See Appendix H for more info on the
  CoffeeMud VFS   system.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>SNOOP<br>
       </em>This command can let you watch other players as they  wander
your   world.&nbsp;  This command gives you a second pair of eyes to look
 over  the shoulder of  the player of your choice.&nbsp; You will see everything 
  they see, almost  as if you were them yourself.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>STAT<br>
       </em>This command allows you to do everything from view the  statistical 
   happenings on your world, to the simple charicteristics of a target  mob 
  or player.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>SYSMSGS<br>
       </em>This important little trick is vital to those doing  CoffeeMud
 development   from the command line. It gives the Archon a unique vision
 of the world  sometimes necessary for his work.&nbsp; For one, it makes
 everything visible  to the Archon regardless of its state of visibility,
 darkness, fog, or any/all  other conditions.&nbsp; It also reveals the unique
  identifying codes, classes,   and names by which things are known or  identified.&nbsp; 
 All of this is  very important when trying to modify or destroy  things you
 no longer want  in your world.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>SHUTDOWN<br>
       </em>Although CoffeeMud can also be brought down by killing  the Java
  virtual  machine, the proper way to shut down CoffeeMud is by entering
 the  shutdown  command.&nbsp; This will ensure that all users are saved
back to   disk, and  that the system goes down in a polite and orderly manner.&nbsp;
  </p>
               
<p><em>TAKE<br>
       </em>Use this command  if a player or monster has something that doesn't 
   belong to them, and you need  it back.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>TICKTOCK<br>
       </em>This simple little power  will advance the world's time clock 
by  one  hour every time it is used.&nbsp; If  it's day, and you want it to
be  night,  or vis-versa, this is the way to go.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>TRAILTO<br>
       </em>A tool to tell the Archon the twistings and turns from  where 
he  is,  to where he'd like to be.</p>
               
<p><em>TRANSFER<br>
       </em>Allows the Archon to zap&nbsp;someone directly to the  room or
 mob   of his or her choice.&nbsp; The argument is either ALL or the name
 of the   target, and a valid Room ID, room name, mob name, or area name.&nbsp;
 Use    this when you want someone to go somewhere NOW.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>UNLINK<br>
       </em>This command will&nbsp;separate two places from one  together.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>UNLOAD<br>
       </em>If you've made any changes to your help files or other  resources,
   and don't want to have to reboot the whole MUD, you can use this  command
   as a short-cut.&nbsp; It unloads "resources" (try "list resources") that
   are in memory.&nbsp; By unloading resources from memory, you force CoffeeMud 
   to  reload your changes from disk.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>WHERE<br>
       </em>Allows the Archon to who all is online, and where they  are on
 the   map. An argument, such as "where orc",&nbsp;may be given to specify
 a  specific   mob name.&nbsp; That way, you can find out where you might
have  misplaced   that wandering zombie.&nbsp; Where can also be used to
locate rooms,  items,   or almost anything else.&nbsp; The mind boggles at
the possibilities.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>WIZEMOTE<br>
       </em>The omnipresence of the Archon is reflected in this  command, 
which    causes a message to appear throughout the world.</p>
               
<p align="left"><em>WIZINV<br>
       </em>Sometimes an Archon wants a little privacy, and this  command 
gives    it to him or her.&nbsp; It will make the Archon completely  undetectable, 
   allowing free movement without harassment from players or  monsters.</p>
               
<p align="left"><strong><font color="red" size="5"><a name="security">Security</a></font></strong> 
   </p>
               
<p align="left">CoffeeMud has&nbsp;an extremely flexible and  powerful security 
   system.&nbsp; It allows the Archons to designate who has which  powers, 
 and  where they may exercise them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Powers can be doled out to 
  minions  as they deserve and warrant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
               
<p align="left">By default, all players who have&nbsp;levels  in the class 
   of Archon are all powerful system administrators, who may perform  all 
of   the powers discussed in the last section and many many more.&nbsp; Of 
 course,   this does not NEED to be the definition of the all powerful, but 
 since  it  is for starters, we will&nbsp;continue as if Archon and&nbsp;'All 
 Powerful    Super Duper System Administrator' are indeed and always the same.&nbsp;
  If you  wish&nbsp;to change it, the SYSOPMASK setting in your&nbsp;coffeemud.ini 
   file is  the place to go, or to the &nbsp;<a href="MUDGrinder.html">MUDGrinder</a> 
   has a wonderful tool for security  in the Control Panel.</p>
               
<p align="left">While players are just players, and are unable  to wipe their 
   own noses without an Archon to provide them a tissue, they may  also be 
 much  more with the wave of an Archon's hand.&nbsp; The Security setting 
 one sees  when using the command MODIFY USER <em>playername</em> from the 
 command line  can be used to give  players a small portion of the creative 
 powers.&nbsp;  By combining this with the  Staff setting under Areas (see 
 below), players  can have their powers narrowed to  certain spheres of influence.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
   A customized Character Class can also be used to expand  the creative power
   of players by adding Security Group Levels to your players  character class.&nbsp;
   See the section on creating your own custom character classes for  more
 information  on this.&nbsp;</p>
               
<p align="left">To upgrade the powers of a player, you may use the MODIFY 
   command as  mentioned previously.&nbsp; From the Security setting, players 
   who are not SYSOPS  may be granted very specific privileges by adding special
   security codes. Each&nbsp;of  the privileges/flags may be limited to specific
   areas, or available  globally.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each&nbsp;entry listed under
Security   for a player may be  either a security Group, or&nbsp;a specific
security   code. Security Groups, like  the SYSOPMASK mentioned above,&nbsp;are
also   defined in the coffeemud.ini file  or from the <a
 href="MUDGrinder.html">MUDGrinder</a>                                   
                                                   Control Panel. A Security&nbsp;Group 
  consists of a  group name,  and a set of string codes representing privileges 
   for&nbsp;that group. The  string codes are the security flags.&nbsp; The 
   Group names in the Control  Panel start with the string  "GROUP_", but 
only  the part after that string  is a valid group  name.&nbsp; You should 
never  include the "GROUP_" part when entering a group name into a  players 
Security  settings.&nbsp;</p>
               
<p align="left">Now, each individual security code&nbsp;which makes up&nbsp;each 
    of the groups is implicitly global (meaning the power may be used anywhere), 
   but  can be&nbsp;qualified as area-only&nbsp;by prefixing the code with 
 the   word&nbsp;AREA and a space.&nbsp; For example, the security code "ANNOUNCE" 
   by  itself&nbsp;confers the global ability to use the ANNOUNCE command. 
 The  security  code&nbsp;"AREA ANNOUNCE" means that the ANNOUNCE command 
can only  be used  inside areas&nbsp;where the player is listed as Staff.&nbsp; 
  See  the section on  Areas in this guide for more information on Staff.</p>
               
<p align="left">Use HELP SECURITY, or access the Control  Panel from the <a
 href="MUDGrinder.html">MUDGrinder</a> for a list of recognized security 
codes.</p>
               
<p><strong><font color="purple" size="5"><a name="planning">Building Your 
   World:  Planning is the First Step</a></font></strong></p>
               
<p>Before a single bird can flitter through the skies that  you opened up, 
   you must have planned the placement of that sky, and the song of  that 
bird.&nbsp;   I am assuming you have been given some general area to  construct, 
some wicked  kingdom, joyous elven city by the sea, or some other such  nonsense.&nbsp; 
   If not, get one; decide on the general theme of some area you  wish to 
construct.</p>
               
<p>At this point I suggest you&nbsp;get a piece of graph  paper or parchment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
   Upon it you shall draw small squares next  to each other.&nbsp; Plot out 
  every location you will create.&nbsp; The squares  need not be equal in 
size,  but they need to all fit together somehow.&nbsp;  Before invoking the
spells  of creation, you should know where every door leads,  where every 
path ends,   and if X indeed marks the spot, where the X is.<br>
       <br>
       Inside each square, you shall make  small notes.&nbsp; What notes?&nbsp; 
   Well, that's the next part of our  story.</p>
               
<p><strong><font color="purple" size="5"><a name="rooms">Understanding  Rooms</a></font></strong></p>
               
<p>At the foundation of the CoffeeMud world is the  room.&nbsp; Now, a room 
   is not just some pink wallpapered play area, but simply  a place.&nbsp; 
 Certainly  a kitchen can be a room, as can a pink wallpapered play  area, 
 but so can  the bottom of a well, a stretch of rolling hills, the top of 
a  tall mountain,  or a dragon&#8217;s lair deep underground.&nbsp; Physical size 
 does not  matter  with rooms; only your imagination can determine that.</p>
               
<p>Every room has a general foundational type that defines  it.&nbsp; That 
   type determines the behavior of that room day to day, whether it  is outside 
   or inside, made of wood or stone, a mountain or a plain, in darkness  or
  light, a cliffside or deep in the ocean.&nbsp; The type determines whether 
   one breathes water or air,&nbsp;chops wood or fishes, and how good the 
hunting    is.&nbsp; This foundational type of every room has a name: Locale.&nbsp;</p>
               
<p>If you log into CoffeeMud right now, you can list the  available Locales 
   with the command "list locales".&nbsp; This list should  include many different
   types of locales, most of which are  self-explanatory.&nbsp; They include:</p>

<p>The type of room you pick can have an important impact on the residents 
   of  your world.&nbsp; The type of room can determine whether there is a
 sky  above  the players, whether players in the room are affected by weather 
 events,  whether  there is any light in the room by default, whether nightfall 
 affects  the  lighting in the room, whether players drown or require swimming, 
 what  kinds of  resources are available from the various player resource-gathering 
   common  skills, and whether certain spells, prayers, skills, or commands 
  work properly  (Dirt Kicking doesn't work in ShallowWater, for instance).</p>
               
<p>For each room you are drawing on your graph parchment, you should note 
   in the  Locale type of the room from the above list, or from the list you
   received when  you entered "list locales" into CoffeeMud.&nbsp; Keep in
 mind  that some rooms  are multi-rooms.&nbsp; These Grids and Mazes represent 
 2-Dimensional  grids of  rooms of a single sort.&nbsp; The dimensions are 
 entirely up to  you, and can  range from a thin 1x20 trail, to a wide 15x15 
 block.&nbsp; The mazes expand on  this by creating weaving paths through 
the grids.</p>
               
<p>The detailed properties of rooms are discussed further  in the section 
   on creating rooms.</p>
               
<p><strong><font color="purple" size="5"><a name="exits">Understanding  Exits</a></font></strong></p>
               
<p>Now surely you did not expect everyone to conjure him or  herself from 
   place to place!&nbsp; Why, the pitiful halfling thieves would  starve in
  their holes if this were so.&nbsp; No, each of the rooms you have  drawn 
 on your paper will be connected with things called Exits.</p>
               
<p>For any two rooms that one can travel between, there are  always two exits.&nbsp; 
   One exit leads from the first room to the second.  Another exit leads from
   the second room to the first.&nbsp; Usually those exits  are the same,
but   they need not be if you don't want them to be so.</p>
               
<p>All exits will take a person from one room to another,  and may even take 
   them back again if you choose.&nbsp; An exit can only be  located in one 
  of six directions: North, South, East, West, Up, and Down.&nbsp;  The four 
  compass directions are easy to fathom, but be careful with up and down, 
 as they need not be unhindered flight, or a reckless fall.&nbsp; If, for 
 instance,  the destination room is a Locale like "InTheAir", then Up obviously 
  represents  the open sky.&nbsp; If it is another "StoneRoom", however, it
  probably represents  a flight of stairs.&nbsp; The Down direction may represent
  falling off a  cliff, but it may also represent a ladder down to the  basement.&nbsp;
  Either  way is fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
               
<p>Exits, like rooms, can be of many different types.&nbsp;  If you are still 
   in CoffeeMud, enter the command "list exits".&nbsp; The list  you receive 
   describes the many connectors that can be mixed and matched between  rooms.&nbsp; 
   Some include doors, and some include doors with locks.&nbsp; There  are 
 walkways  with pits, doors with needle traps, and many others.&nbsp; By far
  the most  common of these Exits is called "Open".&nbsp; It describes a
completely   free and clear path between the two rooms you are creating.&nbsp;

<p>As you finish your graph parchment drawing, be sure to  note those places 
   where there are doors, locked doors, pit traps, and open  walkways.&nbsp; 
   If a door is one way, or if a door leads to one place when one  enters, 
 but  does not go back to there when one leaves, make a note of that  too.</p>
               
<p>However, it may come to pass that there is a rickety  straw door to some 
   hut you wish to have, but it was not listed among your  choices.&nbsp; 
Fear   not, for there is "GenExit" and "GenDoor".&nbsp; "GenExit"  stands 
for "Generic   Exit", and represents the finest in Archon power.&nbsp; A 
completely customizable   exit flowing from one room to another.&nbsp; And 
thusly  are exits divided   from each other: the GenExits and GenDoors are 
customizable,  flexible, changable,  and otherwise maleable.&nbsp; All the 
other exits, however,  are "Standard",  meaning they are not very customizable 
at all, but they do load  very quickly,  and take up very little memory compared 
to a GenExit.&nbsp;  GenExits, as  well as the other features of exits, are 
discussed further in the  section  on creating exits.</p>

       <strong><font color="purple" size="5"><a name="mobintro">Understanding 
  That  Which Creepeth Upon the  Land</a></font></strong></p>
               
<p>The denizens of your land are surely the greatest  accomplishment you will
claim.&nbsp; From the lowly cooks in your kitchens to  the great beasts in
the darkest dungeons, it is they who will be remembered by  those who visit
your realm.&nbsp;</p>
               
<p>Funny then that for things so important, they should  have such a short, 
   ugly sounding name: MOB.&nbsp; If you are in CoffeeMud, you  can list them:
   "list mobs".&nbsp; It will show you every creature that can  populate your
   cities, dwell in your dungeons, or hide in your pantries.&nbsp;  They
are    too numerous to list here.&nbsp;</p>
               
<p>If a creature is not listed there that you require,  there is always the 
   GenMob, that nasty formless being that can be shaped by the  Archon to 
appear   and behave exactly as it should.&nbsp; GenShopkeepers, GenPostman, 
and  GenBankers&nbsp;are&nbsp;available  to provide valuable services for 
your  community.&nbsp; GenDeitys give your  Clerics employment. GenRideable 
mobs  provide transport.&nbsp; For more devious  spirits, however, the GenUndead 
 is  also available, to strike fear in the  hearts of the purest cleric.&nbsp; 
 These  mobs just mentioned&nbsp;form the  troupe of "Generic" mobs, meaning 
 they are  customizable and changeable from  inside the mud.&nbsp; The other 
 mobs  listed&nbsp;are classified as species  "Standard" mob, meaning they 
 are not  nearly as customizable, though they  do load quickly, and take up
 much less  memory than the "Generic" mobs do.</p>
               
<p>GenMobs, as well as the features of MOBs, are discussed  further in the 
   section on creating MOBs.</p>
               
<p><strong><font color="purple" size="5"><a name="itemintro">The Things We 
    Treasure</a></font></strong></p>
               
<p>Our last planning topic is that of the items that will  be found in your 
   land.&nbsp; Some of them will be priceless once-in-a-lifetime  creations.&nbsp; 
   Others will be reoccurring trapped chests that always seem to  have enough 
   gold for those bold enough to continuously risk their guardians.</p>
               
<p>The items can be discovered using the "list items"  command.&nbsp; Other 
   items include weapons, which can be discovered through  "list weapons", 
 armor  from "list armor", and other miscellaneous enchanted items  through 
 "list  magic".&nbsp; </p>
               
<p>For those items you need by are not present, there is  also the "GenItem",&nbsp;"GenBoat", 
   "GenChair", "GenTable", "GenBed", "GenLimb",  "GenCoins", "GenCorpse", 
"GenKey",   "GenLantern", "GenLightSource", "GenCigar",  "GenPipe", "GenMap",&nbsp;&nbsp;"GenResource", 
   "GenLiquidResource",  "GenFoodResource", "GenRideable", "GenWallpaper", 
 "GenJournal",  "GenContainer",  "GenFood", "GenDrink", "GenWater", and "GenReadable".&nbsp; 
   For the fighting  spirit there is the "GenWeapon", "GenStaff", and "GenArmor".&nbsp; 
   Among  the&nbsp;formless magical items are "GenPill", "GenPowder", "GenPotion", 
    "GenScroll", "GenWand", and "GenSuperPill".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These items 
   just  mentioned&nbsp;form the&nbsp;gluttony of "Generic" items, meaning 
 they  are  customizable and changeable from inside the mud.&nbsp; The other 
 items   listed&nbsp;are classified as "Standard" items, meaning they are 
not nearly  as  customizable, though they do load quickly, and take up much 
less memory  than the  "Generic" items do.&nbsp; These and the many properties 
 of items  are discussed  below under the section on creating items.</p>
               
<p><strong><font color="purple" size="5"><a name="creation">The Art of  Creation</a></font></strong></p>
               
<p>Before beginning, you should log into CoffeeMud and take  yourself to some
place that is adjacent to the area you will be forming.&nbsp;  You should 
   also cast the spell of natural enlightenment using the following  command: 
   "sysmsgs".&nbsp; You should see an utterance that reads "Extended  messages 
   are now: ON".&nbsp; </p>
               
<p>Now your eyes will behold new wonders when you look  around the rooms:&nbsp; 
   You will see the Locale types of the room, the Room IDs  that have been 
 assigned  uniquely to each room, the Area IDs of the area you are  in.&nbsp; 
 They should  look like this:</p>
               
<p>Area&nbsp; :(MyArea)<br>
       Locale:  (StoneRoom)&nbsp; <br>
       (MyArea#123) Joe Bob's Room</p>
               
<p>The first line lists the area name, the second line the  locale type we 
   talked about earlier, and the&nbsp;third line lists the Room ID,  followed 
   by the Room Name.&nbsp; Take note of them all, my friend, and learn to 
 appreciate  their beauty.&nbsp; </p>
               
<p><strong><font color="blue" size="5"><a name="roomcreate">Creating  Rooms</a></font></strong></p>
               
<p>Now that you have your plan laid out, it is quite time  to being execution.&nbsp; 
   Gather your strength, and begin harnessing the power  of the Archon, for 
  you will need every ounce of it when the wood and rock chips  start flying.</p>
               
<p>To create a new room most easily, you must first be  standing in&nbsp;a 
   room adjacent to it,&nbsp;one that will be connected to it  through some 
  exit.&nbsp; You will then utter the invocation of room creation,  summoning 
  the Locale in the direction that the new room should be.&nbsp; For  instance, 
  you wish to have a new room&nbsp;north of room "MyArea#123".&nbsp; If  room&nbsp;"MyArea#123&#8221;
   is already created, and the new room&nbsp;is going to be  of the "StoneRoom"
   Locale, you would bring yourself to room&nbsp;"MyArea#123"  and utter
the    words:&nbsp; "create stoneroom north".</p>
               
<p><img alt="" src="images/createroom.gif">
       </p>
               
<p>At this point, you should cover your ears, as the sound  of a stone room 
   falling to the north is often quite disturbing.&nbsp; Between  the two 
rooms;   the one you are standing in, and the one you have created, will 
be a default   exit: the Open exit.&nbsp; Most times, that is ok, though changing
 it will   be the subject of the next section.</p>
               
<p>However, once this is done, and the rooms are  irrevocably linked, you 
   can still throw a small twist on things.&nbsp; If you  are still standing 
   in room "MyArea#123" and wish to create a NEW StoneRoom in  the SAME direction, 
   it can be done.&nbsp; Uttering the words "create StoneRoom  north" AGAIN 
  and a new room is created.&nbsp; Now, what happened with  "MyArea#124" you&#8217;re
   wondering?&nbsp; It is still there, and it still leads back  to where
you    are standing -- a one way exit.</p>
               
<p><img alt="" src="images/createroom2.gif">
       </p>
               
<p><strong><font color="blue" size="5"><a name="modrooms">Modifying  Rooms</a></font></strong></p>
               
<p>For now, once you have created a new room, it is time to  design the landscape 
   of it.&nbsp; To do this, you should enter the room through  the default 
 Open  exit that was created for you.&nbsp; You will find the room  plain 
and boring.&nbsp;  </p>
               
<p>To give the room a new name and description, utter the  invocation: "modify 
   room" and follow the promptings.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <em>display </em>property 
   is the&nbsp;short name that appears  at the top of the room description, 
  while the <em>description </em>field is the long text.&nbsp; Type  whatever 
  text you like into these fields, and feel the power as the place takes 
on  a new form dictated by your creative magic.&nbsp; These two fields support 
   the CoffeeMud color codes described in the Programmer's guide, as well 
as  line  breaks using either %0D or \n.&nbsp; Normally, that's all you need 
 to  know.&nbsp; However, these fields may also be customized to display different
   text depending on the weather, season, or the time of day.&nbsp; This
last   is  done by starting the field with the string &lt;VARIES&gt;, and
following   it with  text surrounded by the appropriate codes in the following
format:    &lt;CODE&gt;text&lt;/CODE&gt;.&nbsp; In all of these cases, the
codes must   be in  uppercase.&nbsp; Valid codes include: SUMMER, SPRING,
WINTER, FALL,   DAY, NIGHT,  DUSK, DAWN, RAIN, SLEET, SNOW, CLEAR, HEATWAVE,
THUNDERSTORM,   BLIZZARD, WINDY,  DROUGHT, DUSTSTORM, COLD, HAIL, CLOUDY.</p>
               
<p>Rooms of the Grid and Maze sort present unique  challenges to the molder 
   of universes.&nbsp; In the first place, if you have  SYSMSGS turned on, 
 you  will notice that the room ID displayed is a little  different.&nbsp; 
 In addition  to the room ID of the parent room, there is an  additional set
 of parenthesis  showing where you are in the big grid room.&nbsp;  It would
 look something  like this:</p>
               
<p>Area :(Coffee Grounds) <br>
       Locale:(Plains) <br>
       (Coffee  Grounds#19#(0,2)) The Demitasse Demesnes</p>
               
<p>In this case, we are in Coffee Grounds#19, child room at  X=0, Y=2.&nbsp;</p>
               
<p>You will notice that you are unable to modify child rooms  like this one.&nbsp; 
   In the case of Grids and Mazes, you must be inside the  Parent room to 
perform   modifications.&nbsp; To get to the parent room, use the  GOTO command.&nbsp; 
   In the example above, we would enter "goto Coffee  Grounds#19".&nbsp; This
   will allow us to properly modify the room, and add any  creatures (mobs)
  to it later on.</p>
               
<p>Once you are in the parent room of a Grid or Maze, you  may use "modify 
   room" to modify the properties of the entire grid or maze.&nbsp;  You can
   modify things like the dimensions in the X and Y, to make your grid  anything
   from a long hallway to a giant hedge maze.&nbsp; </p>
               
<p>Modifying the <em>display&nbsp;  </em>and <em>description </em>fields also
has unique  consequences inside a Maze or Grid.&nbsp; You may enter a random
selection of  text strings to display into each of these fields, so long
as you remember to  separate each individual text selection by the &lt;P&gt;
string.&nbsp; For  example:</p>
               
<p>Display: 'First Display Title&lt;P&gt;Second Display  Title&lt;P&gt;Third 
   Display Title'<br>
       Description: 'First  Description&lt;P&gt;Second Description&lt;P&gt;Third 
   Description'</p>
               
<p>The above, when placed in a grid or maze locale, will  cause CoffeeMud 
   to select randomly among three different display  title/description combinations.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
   Since there is an equal number of  display and descriptions given (3), 
the   display and titles will always be  matched up in the grid children rooms.&nbsp;
  </p>
               
<p>After you have made your modifications to the grid  parent room display 
   and description, use the "reset room" command to have them  take effect.</p>
               
<p>The "reset room" command will force CoffeeMud not only  to reset a grid 
   or maze, but to reload the creatures and items last saved in the  CoffeeMud 
   database.&nbsp; This can be useful if you make a few critters or  things 
  you don't want to keep and havn't yet saved.&nbsp; A corresponding "reset 
   area" command does the same for the whole area.</p>
               
<p>And speaking of areas,&nbsp;rooms also may have  behaviors and effects 
   added to them, including a few more.&nbsp; In this case,  the behaviors 
 and  effects above will only be active for this particular room.  Aside from
 those  listed under Areas above, here are additional Behaviors you  might
 enjoy:  </p>
               
<p>"DelayedTransporter" causes all those who enter to be  whisked elsewhere.<br>
       "Emoter" - yea -- this is mentioned  under Areas, but it's just sooo 
 cool.<br>
       "FasterRecovery" -  makes the players recover their stats faster in
 this   room.<br>
       "FieryRoom" -  stuff catches on fire here! watch out!<br>
       "InstantDeath" - nuff  said.<br>
       "Mime"&nbsp;causes the  room to mimic players.&nbsp; Wierd.. yea,
I  know.<br>
       "MovingRoom" the fast train to somewhere.<br>
       "ProtectedCitizens" will allow resident mobs to scream for  help and 
 receive   it&nbsp;when attacked.<br>
       "RandomMonsters"  will cause monsters from a saved file to appear
here.<br>

       "ItemGenerator"  will create treasure and items for your rooms.<br>
       "RandomTraps" will  cause random traps to be set here.<br>
       "ResourceOverride" if you want fishing in the desert, or  sand in
your   swap,  this is the way to go.<br>
       "Scriptable" makes the room react to events in a scripted  way.<br>
       "ScriptableEverymob" same as scriptable, but applies itself to all 
the    mobs born here.<br>
       "Sounder" is still a good alternative to Emoter.<br>
       Lots of other  properties and effects are also available for rooms.&nbsp;

<p>Ok! Back to work! </p>
               
<p>If you are ever wandering around, and wish to go  directly to a room you 
   have created, you may utter the magic matra "goto  RoomID".&nbsp; For instance,
   entering "goto MyArea#123" would take you to the  room we created above.&nbsp;
   This will especially come in handy when we begin to  create and destroy
 the  links between rooms, and there is no other way to get to  a room. </p>
               
<p><strong><font color="blue" size="5"><a name="linkrooms">Linking Two Rooms 
    Together</a></font></strong></p>
               
<p>Now that&nbsp;you have created a room, and wish to link  one of the rooms 
   in your area with one of another, you can use a command that  utilizes 
the   Room IDs mentioned above.&nbsp; If you would like to create a  northerly 
  link from room "MyArea#123" to a room whose room ID is "MyArea#124",  then 
  you need only stand in room "MyArea#123" (use the "goto" command if you 
 must),  and utter the invocation:&nbsp; "link MyArea#124 north".&nbsp; This 
 will  create an Open exit between the room you are standing in, and the room
 whose  ID  is born out.&nbsp; </p>
               
<p><img alt="" src="images/linkroom.gif">
       </p>
               
<p>You should note that this command could be used as it  was in the last 
   section to create one-way exits to existing rooms.</p>

<p><strong><font color="blue" size="5"><a name="unlinkrooms">Unlinking Two

<p>If you wish to detach two rooms from each other, you  need only learn the
"unlink" command.&nbsp; If you are standing in the room to  the south of
the one you wish to unlink, and the room you wish to detach from is  to the
north, utter the command: "unlink north".&nbsp; It will do the trick!</p>
               
<p><img alt="" src="images/destroyroom.gif">
       </p>
               
<p>Keep in mind that just because there is no longer a  route from the room 
   you are in to the other via a northerly path, it does not  mean that there 
   is no path from the detached room back to here again.&nbsp; You  may have 
   to conjure yourself into the&nbsp;other place and enter a "unlink  south" 
   command to completely detach them forever.</p>
               
<p><strong><font color="blue" size="5"><a name="xrooms">Destroying a  Room</a></font></strong></p>
               
<p>Sometimes the pain born from a failed or evil place is  too much to bear, 
   and as an Archon, you can do something about it.&nbsp; This  involves the
   destroy command.&nbsp; It does not merely unlink the room, but  obliterates 
   it altogether and forever.&nbsp; To do this, first make sure you are  not
   standing in the room you wish to destroy.&nbsp; Such destructive magic 
would    surely be your end as well.&nbsp; Then you must utilize the Room 
ID of the   doomed place.&nbsp; If the room you wish to destroy has the Room 
ID of  "MyArea#124", then enter:&nbsp; "destroy MyArea#124".&nbsp; It will 
obliterate   that place from the planet forever.</p>

<p><strong><font color="blue" size="5"><a name="exitcreate">Creating  Exits</a></font></strong></p>
               
<p>The difference between Exits and Rooms is a very  important one.&nbsp; 
   Creating and destroying Rooms describes <em>WHETHER</em> two rooms are 
connected,   and by which  direction.&nbsp; Creating and destroying Exits 
describes <em>HOW</em>   one gets from one room to the next.&nbsp; Two  rooms 
must be connected together   before exits between them can be modified.</p>
               
<p>For instance, suppose you linked "MyArea#123" and  "MyArea#124" as described 
   above.&nbsp; By default, you get an StdOpenDoorway,  also known as an "Open"
   exit.&nbsp; These exits can be walked through  freely.&nbsp; Now suppose
  you wish to have a Door between the two rooms.&nbsp;  If the exits between
  the two rooms are both the same, and you are standing in  the southernmost 
  room of the two, then changing them both is simply a matter of  issuing 
the  command "create Door north".</p>
               
<p><img alt="" src="images/createexit.gif">
       </p>
               
<p><strong><font color="blue" size="5"><a name="xexits">Destroying  Exits</a></font></strong></p>
               
<p>Just as unlinking rooms disconnects them, destroying  exits can SEEM to 
   disconnect them.&nbsp; When you issue a simple destroy  command, and refer 
   specifically to the exit, then you will not be destroying the  link between 
   the two rooms, but merely the exit that travels between them.&nbsp;  Archons 
   can still travel through these missing links, but players will not be 
able   to.&nbsp; Also, destroying an exit only deletes the exit in one direction, 
    not both.&nbsp; For instance, if you are standing in the southerly room 
  of two  linked rooms that both have Exits between them, and you issue the 
  command  "destroy exit north", you will destroy the Open exit between the 
  rooms.&nbsp; As  an Archon, you can still travel north through the destroyed 
  exit, but players  will not be able to.</p>
               
<p><img alt="" src="images/destroyexit.gif">
       </p>
               
<p>&nbsp;</p>
               
<p>Now, that an exit has been deleted, it is possible to  create a DIFFERENT 
   kind of exit for the northerly direction from MyArea#123 to  MyArea#124.&nbsp; 
   Issuing a create command like "create Door north" will create  a door that
   leads from MyArea#123 to MyArea#124, WITHOUT AFFECTING the Open path 
from    MyArea#124 to MyArea#123.&nbsp; This is only possible when the exits 
 between    two rooms are different, or one is deleted, as is our case here.</p>
               
<p><img alt="" src="images/destroyexit3.gif">
       </p>
               
<p>&nbsp;</p>
               
<p>Now, suppose you wanted to have the same Door going  between two rooms.&nbsp; 
   For sure this is a more common scenario than the  example we just went 
through.&nbsp;   To do this, you must first delete BOTH of  the exits between 
two rooms as   described above. That means entering MyArea#123  and entering 
"destroy exit   north", and then entering MyArea#124 and entering  "destroy 
exit south".&nbsp;   </p>
               
<p><img alt="" src="images/destroyexit2.gif">
       </p>
               
<p>Now, with both exits deleted (and thus the same), you  can create a single 
   door between them as we did in the first part of this  section using the 
  "create Door south" command.</p>

<p><strong><font color="blue" size="5"><a name="areas">Creating and Modifying 
    Areas</a></font> </strong></p>
               
<p>A town or village, country or demesnes can hardly come  to be without the
careful demarcation of their borders.&nbsp; What separates the  town from
the country, or one country from another?&nbsp; Like everything else,  this
is the decision of the Archon as he groups his rooms into Areas.&nbsp; </p>
               
<p>The best way to create your areas is to do so right from  the start.&nbsp; 
   The moment you create the first plot of land in your new area,  or lay 
down   the first building in your new town, you should designate it as  such.&nbsp; 
   Enter the new room in your new area and utter the mystic chant  "modify 
 room  area New Area Name".&nbsp; Of course, where "New Area Name" can be 
 anything  you wish.&nbsp; Call it "Newarea Land" or "Goldfish Villiage" or
"The  Fruity  Phantasm" or whatever strikes your fancy. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    Now that you have designated your new room as belonging  to a new area, 
  it is important to remember to create all future rooms  by&nbsp;doing so 
 from&nbsp;rooms that already belong to the new area.&nbsp; Any  future rooms 
 that you build by standing in your new area room will bear its area  mark, 
 as well as any rooms created from any other room bearing the new area  mark.&nbsp; 
 If you fail then, you may be forced to invoke the power of the  "modify room
 area..." command again to re-group the rooms you are creating.<br>
       
<p>   When you create a new area, you will be asked for the arcane "type
of area" you want to create. &nbsp;We will now take a second to peruse the
different area types:        </p>

 &nbsp;All of CoffeeMuds features work just fine with it, as it has no restrictions
  or limitations. &nbsp;The standard area always has its own weather, and
inherets  its calendar. &nbsp;Use this type for your most often used areas,
your areas  with lots of special features, and your most important areas,

 you have defined for it. &nbsp;The maximum rooms is always width X height.
 &nbsp;You probably won't notice any differences between a standard area
and  a standard grid area unless you use the MUDGrinder visual area editor.
&nbsp;This  is because grid areas always position their rooms at a single
coordinate location on the visual editor screen, and it never ever moves
from that position. &nbsp;This can be a blessing for those creating carefully
pre-planned areas that fit nicely in 2 dimensional graphs. &nbsp;It can also
be a blessing for big areas (&gt; 200 rooms), since the MUDGrinder will let
you edit a grid area in sections, and the rooms won't move around on you
when you re-link them. &nbsp;Use this area type if you do a lot of MUDGrinder
visual work. &nbsp;It can be a curse for more organic area designers, however.&nbsp;</td>

  areas will also periodically unload their rooms when they havn't been accessed
  in 40 minutes or so. &nbsp;Thin areas are fantastic for enormous (&gt;1000)
  room areas that span massive ranges. &nbsp;They won't gobble up your system
  resources. &nbsp;They are bad for popular areas though, and for areas with
  lots of special features. &nbsp;Things like the legal system and conquest
  system don't work well with them, since an officer may not know where to
 find the local judge when someone is arrested (if the judges chambers are
 one of the rooms not yet loaded). &nbsp;If you are short on memory, or your

Enter  the secret code "modify area" to  go through a list of these modifiable 
  properties.&nbsp;  </p>
               
<p>The&nbsp;<em>name</em> and <em>description</em> of the area may be changed 
   by following  the promptings.&nbsp; You may also tinker with the <em>climate</em> 
   of your area, which will affect the types of  weather that will blow through 
   it, and how mild or severe the winters and  summers may be.&nbsp;&nbsp;This 
   is also where you may add <em>Staff</em>.&nbsp; A&nbsp;player whose name 
  is listed as  Staff&nbsp;has no additional powers unless their player Security 
   settings grant  them specific AREA privileges.&nbsp; In that case, the 
player   would be able to  use their area privileges in the area where they 
are listed   as  Staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;The section on Security above mentions 
all this stuff   in more  detail.&nbsp; Typically, a player is listed as Staff,
and then given  several  area creation privileges in order to assist in area
building and   modifying.&nbsp; After&nbsp;all, sometimes&nbsp;creating a
universe becomes  a  little bit too much work for one person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
               
<p>Strange settings like <em>Technology Level</em> and <em>Archive  File Name</em>
are available on the area promptings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't worry  about these.&nbsp;
The former is not very important at the moment, and the  second is a bit
too obscure for these lessons.&nbsp; The <em>Currency</em> field is discussed
in detail in the next  section on What Areas are Worth.</p>
               
<p>You will also be asked to add any <em>behaviors </em>and <em>effects</em> 
   to  the&nbsp;area that you wish to.&nbsp; These may seem strange at first, 
   and  usually you won't add any of these at all.&nbsp; After all, rarely 
 does  a plot  of dirt exibit any behavior, and what the heck is an effect?&nbsp; 
   Well! To the  first, the wind blowing through the trees, the hoot of an 
 owl,  or a distant  cackling noise are all considerable behaviors.&nbsp; 
In fact,  it is a behavior  called "Emoter".&nbsp; Enter "ahelp emoter" for 
more information  about the  Emoter behavior.&nbsp; There are other behaviors 
that Areas may  benefit from  too. Here are some examples: </p>
               
<p>"Arrest" will add law and order to your area, with  resident mobs playing 
   the cops and the judges.<br>
       "Conquerable" has all the features of Arrest, plus it makes  the area
  conquerable  by clans!<br>
       "Emoter" is what I  mentioned above -- it's for inserting those cute 
 little   blurbs in the area.<br>
       "FasterRoom" makes everything happen twice as fast here (or  faster!)<br>
       "InstantDeath" makes everything that comes here  DIE!!!!!<br>
       "LinkedWeather" makes the weather in this area  mimic the weather
from   another  area.<br>
       "ProtectedCitizens"  will allow resident mobs to scream for help and 
 receive   it&nbsp;when  attacked.<br>
       "PuddleMaker" will scatter some puddles around  after rain or snow.<br>
       "RandomMonsters" will populate the  area with lots of hideously random 
  creatures  that you choose.<br>
       "RandomItems"  will cause items from a saved file to appear here.<br>
        "ItemGenerator"  will create treasure and items for your rooms.<br>
       "RandomTraps" will scatter some traps around your area.<br>
       "ResetWhole" will cause the whole area to re-boot every so  often, 
thus   supplementing the natural "rejuv" process. <br>
       "Scriptable" allows you to script the behavior of the room  in a limited 
   sense.<br>
       "ScriptableEverymob" allows you to  script all the mobs in the area
 at  once.<br>
       "Sounder" is  also for inserting little blurbs, plus it reacts to
player    actions.<br>
       "WaterCurrents" will make those on the water bob and flow  in the
direction    you specify.<br>
       "WeatherAffects" will make the players really  FEEL the weather.</p>
               
<p>As for effects, well, effects are special properties  which you can attach 
   to your new little holes in the ground.&nbsp; There are  lots of nice properties
   that one may add to an&nbsp;Area, which will affect  every room in it,
such   as: </p>
               
<p>"Merchant" to establish a store front that follows the  players from room 
   to room.<br>
       "Prop_AreaForSale" to make the entire area  purchasable by a shopkeeper
   in the area.<br>
       "Prop_CommonTwister" to mix up the  resources gained from using gathering 
   skills in the area.<br>
       "Prop_Crawlspace"  to make the entire area require crawling through.<br>
       "Prop_EnlargeRoom" makes  crossing the area eat up more Movement.<br>
       "Prop_MagicFreedom" to fluster any spell-using  folks that happen
along.<br>
       "Prop_Hidden" will make the area  unlisted to normal players.<br>
       "Prop_ModExperience" modifies experience gained in this  area..<br>
       "Prop_NoChannel" for a place of quiet.<br>
       "Prop_NoCharm"  lets everyone remember who their REAL friends are.<br>
       "Prop_NoPKill"  keeps out the riffraff.<br>
       "Prop_NoRecall" keeps folks from taking the easy way out.<br>
       "Prop_NoSummon" makes sure that everyone leaves of their own  free 
will.<br>
       "Prop_NoTeleport" keeps those silly  mages from teleporting in.<br>
       "Prop_NoTelling" prevents players from using the  TELL command to
each   other.<br>
       "Prop_NoTeleportOut" keeps those silly mages IN.  <br>
       "Prop_PeaceMaker" to go with it if you want peace AND quiet.&nbsp; 
 <br>
       "Prop_ReqAlignments" lets you limit the alignment of all who  enter.<br>
       "Prop_ReqCapacity" lets you limit the number of folks or items in
the    rooms.<br>
       "Prop_ReqClasses" lets you limit the character class of those who
 enter.<br>
       "Prop_ReqNoMOB" to make your area a player-only place to be.&nbsp; 
 <br>
       "Prop_RestrictSpells" lets you limit specific skills or spells from
 being    used here.<br>
       "Prop_RoomDark" makes the whole area a place in need of  light.<br>
       "Prop_RoomUnmappable" makes the whole area unmappable by mundane 
means.<br>
       "Prop_ReqEntry" lets you limit entry  to folks by many different criteria.<br>
       "Prop_ReqHeight"  keeps out tall people, or at least those unwilling 
 to  crawl.<br>
       "Prop_ReqLevels" lets you limit entry by levels.<br>
       "Prop_ReqRaces" lets you limit entry by race.<br>
       "Prop_ReqTattoo" lets you limit  entry to players with certain builder-definable 
   tags.<br>
       "Prop_ReqPKill" makes this a place that only the bloodthirsty  may 
enter.<br>
       "Prop_Smell" gives off a unique aroma when players use  their SNIFF
 command.<br>
       "Prop_Weather" to have the same weather in an Area all the  time.<br>

<p><strong><font color="#0000ff" size="5">What Areas are Worth</font></strong></p>
               
<p>Currency is the system of&nbsp;money used by the  inhabitants of the area.&nbsp;It 
   is defined using the <em>Currency</em> field when creating and modifying 
  Areas as  discussed in the previous section.&nbsp; All of the bankers, money
  changers, tax  collectors, postmen, and shopkeepers will deal in the&nbsp;currency
  that you  define for the area.&nbsp; &nbsp;By default, all areas will use
  a system of  currency that includes gold coins, and golden notes, whole
notes,  and Archon  notes.&nbsp; You can change this system by defining your
own,  however.&nbsp; The  way you do this is by entering a name for your
currency,  followed by an equal  sign, and then a series of relative&nbsp;values
and  currency names, all  separated by semicolons.&nbsp; Let's look at an
example:</p>
               
<p></p>
             
<pre>US=0.01 penny(s);0.1 dime(s);.25 quarter(s);1.0 dollar(s)<br></pre>
               
<p></p>
               
<p>In the&nbsp;currency we have defined here, we have four  different currencies: 
   the penny, the dime, the quarter, and the dollar.&nbsp;  Notice that each 
   currency is separated by a semicolon in our definition  string.&nbsp; Each
   entry includes two or possibly three parts.&nbsp; The first  part is the
  base value, the second part is the name of the currency, and the  optional
  third part is a "short name" used by shopkeepers when listing  prices.</p>
               
<p>The first part of each currency entry tell us how much  one unit of that 
   currency is worth <strong><em>relative to the base coffeemud unit of  value</em></strong>.&nbsp;
   This base unit of value is used throughout the  system, and can be thought
   of as equal to one gold coin in the default  currency.&nbsp; For this
reason,    it is wise for Archons to become familiar with  the value of things
in the   default currency before defining their own.&nbsp;  Under the system
we gave   in our example, a penny is worth 0.01 or 1/100th of a  base coffeemud
 unit   of value.&nbsp; The dollar is worth 1.0 or exactly one base  unit
value.&nbsp;&nbsp;   The only rule when defining the worth of your currency
 units is that all   currency values MUST be evenly divisible by the lowest
valued  unit.&nbsp;   In this case, all of our values are evenly divisible
by the penny,  so we   are safe.&nbsp;</p>
               
<p>The second part of each currency entry is the  name&nbsp;of the currency&nbsp;unit.&nbsp; 
   This can be any name you  choose.&nbsp; &nbsp;The fact that the name of 
 the  currency ends with (s) tells  us that the system should include the 
trailing  letter 's' when there are more  than one of that currency unit listed.</p>
               
<p>It is completely optional, but if you wish, you may also  include a short 
   name for each currency unit entry.&nbsp; If an entry contains a  short 
name,   it will tell the shopkeeper to try and display its currency using 
 just those  units.&nbsp; If none of the unit entrys contain short names, 
then  shopkeepers  will tend to display their prices in multiples of the lowest
valued  unit,  in this case, pennys.&nbsp; Here is an example of that same
currency  redefined  with short names.:</p>
               
<p></p>
             
<pre>US=0.01 penny(s) (p);0.1 dime(s) (d);.25 quarter(s) (q);1.0 dollar(s) ($)<br></pre>
               
<p></p>
               
<p>In this new example, we have defined short forms for  each currency, allowing 
   shopkeepers to choose the most appropriate one.&nbsp;  The prices will 
END   with the letter p, d, s, or q depending upon which currency  the shopkeeper 
   chooses to display the currency in.</p>
               
<p>Once you have defined your currency in at least one  area, you may use 
   it throughout your mud by simply entering its name alone in  the <em>Currency 
   </em>field when you edit your area  settings.&nbsp; In our example, US 
would   be a sufficient value for the <em>Currency</em> field to tell the 
system  to re-use our US  currency in that area.&nbsp; You may also redefine 
the default coffeemud  currency throughout the entire system by NOT entering 
a name for your  currency.&nbsp; For example.:</p>
               
<p></p>
             
<pre>=0.01 penny(s) (p);0.1 dime(s) (d);.25 quarter(s) (q);1.0 dollar(s) ($)<br></pre>
               
<p></p>
               
<p>This last example, since it contains a blank currency  name, would make 
   our U.S. currency system the default one used throughout  coffeemud, or 
 wherever  the <em>Currency </em>value in the  area settings is also empty.</p>

<p><strong><font color="blue" size="5"><a name="itemcreate">Creating  Items</a></font></strong></p>
               
<p>For our purposes, an item is any normal item, piece of  armor, a weapon, 
   a container, or any magical item, armor, or weapon.&nbsp; To  bring one 
 of  these things into the world, you have only to call its true name  using 
 the  create command.&nbsp; To create a Longsword, for instance, issue the 
  command  "create Longsword".&nbsp; It will then fall from the sky onto the
 floor  or ground before you.</p>
               
<p>To find out what items are available for you to create,  you can enter 
   "list items".&nbsp; Entering "create &lt;itemname&gt;" will prove  the 
true   incantation for almost all of the items on this list.&nbsp; An  exception, 
   however, is the GenRideable.&nbsp; Since there is both an Item and  a&nbsp;MOB 
   version of that name, you will need to further qualify your create  command 
   by entering "create item GenRideable" or "create mob GenRideable".</p>
               
<p><strong><a name="geni1"><font style="background-color: lime;">The "GenItem",

<p>These represent some of the basic items your ordinary  denizen will use 
   every day.&nbsp; A GenItem and  GenMirror&nbsp;represent&nbsp;nothing-special 
   THINGS.&nbsp; GenResource is a raw  material, like iron, coal, or wood, 
 from  which other things are made, especially  with the common skills.&nbsp; 
 GenReadables  are GenItems with something to read  on them, like a book or
 parchment.</p>
               
<p>Whenever a GenItem is created, much like the GenExit  above, you are presented 
   with a list of properties to fill in.&nbsp; Pressing  enter will leave 
the   property unchanged.&nbsp; The properties include:</p>

from the  room. In this case, it is the number of ticks (4 second       
intervals)&nbsp;between    the removal time, and the time the item      
 rejuvinates. For more information    on making the RejuvTicks property take

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If        this item is located in a mobs
inventory,    this value represents the %        chance of it appearing in
the mobs inventory    after reset. In this case,        the value should
be between 1-100, or  0  to also represent 100 (always        available).&nbsp;&nbsp;

       <br>
       GenJournals represent message  boards for players to commonly post

 will  display the same set of messages  to readers, regardless of how many
 GenJournals  there are.&nbsp; Players who have  access to GenJournals, and
 who have the  Write skill may write new messages, or  post replies to old
 ones on GenJournals.</p>
               
<p>GenJournals may be books that individual players carry  around and magically 
   chat with each other on (assuming all their journals have  the same name).&nbsp; 
   They may also be large public posting boards.&nbsp; To  make one of this 
  last sort, simply make the journal non-gettable.&nbsp; That  way, people 
 can write on them even if they can't pick them up.</p>
               
<p>One special kind of journal is called "CoffeeMud  News".&nbsp; If a Journal 
   is given that name (without the quotes, and yes --  watch your spelling 
 and  case), then all messages posted to it will be echoed to  all players 
 whenever  they log on next.&nbsp; For this reason, you will want to  keep 
 journals with than name close to your vest.</p>
               
<p>Archons can also create special "persistant" journal  entries, whether 
   they be in custom journals or in CoffeeMud News.&nbsp; These  entries remain
   "new" longer than normal ones.&nbsp; These are created by  starting off
 an  entry subject with the letters MOTD (for message of the day),  MOTM, 
or MOTY.&nbsp;  If a subject starts with those letters, in uppercase, the 
 entry will persist  as new for a day, month, or year respectively.</p>
               
<p>Archons can also make use of the Web Macros system  inside the body or 
   message part of a journal entry.&nbsp; To do so, the message  must start 
  with the characters &lt;cmvp&gt;.&nbsp; If those six characters start  the
  message, then the message may contain web macros.&nbsp; See the WebServer 
   Guide for more information on this feature.</p>

 work  with your weapon, the values in the ammunitionType fields in  both

 runs out of ammunition for their weapon, it will be drawn from  GenAmmunition 
 objects,  provided they are in the players inventory.</p>
               
<p>GenAmmunition differs from other items not only in its  inability to be 
   held, but also in its ability to transfer any Effects on itself  to the 
 weapon.&nbsp;  Whenever a weapon draws ammunition from a GenAmmunition  type,
 properties,  spells, and other Effects on the Ammunition will be  transferred

 their mob holders to perform tasks. The GenClanFlag holds a conquered area

<p>GenWallpaper is unique in that it is a non-gettable item  which&nbsp;is 
   never listed among the items in&nbsp;a room, but CAN be looked  at.&nbsp; 
   It is intended to&nbsp;provide targets for the LOOK command based upon

  make  sure they have SYSMSGS turned on to edit wallpaper items, since they 
 will   not be&nbsp;noticed otherwise.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><a name="geni25"><font style="background-color: lime;">The "GenRecipe"</font></a></strong></p>
               
<p>GenWallpaper is a complex but powerful tool for  expanding the system of
Common Skills in the CoffeeMud codebase.&nbsp; A  GenRecipe is a piece of
paper upon which is written a recipe, schematic, or some  other instructions 
   for enhancing the list of things which can be crafted by  players using 
 their  crafting Common Skills.&nbsp; A player takes advantage of a  recipe 
 by mearly  having the item in his or her inventory and using the  appropriate 
 skill for which the recipe was designed.</p>
               
<p>Designing a GenRecipe object is extremely complex.&nbsp;  After setting 
   the "normal" GenItem fields for this item, such as name,  readabletext, 
 weight,  value, etc, there are still the two key GenRecipe fields  left to
 fill in:  Common Skill ID, and the Recipe Data line.&nbsp; The Common  Skill
 ID identifies  which of the common skills is served by the recipe.&nbsp; 
 The Data line describes in detail the item which can be created by players 
 with  this recipe on hand.&nbsp; The format of the data line is a series 
of  comma-delimited values which are defined for each common skill uniquely.&nbsp; 
  There are two ways of determining the number and nature of each value for 
 the  data line.&nbsp; One is to open the appropriate common skill *.java 
file in the  /com/planet_ink/Abilities/Common/ directory on your computer 
and observing the  several lines near the top of the file which begin with 
"protected static final  int RCP_".&nbsp; The number, order, and nature of 
the values will be identical  to these variable definitions.&nbsp; The second 
way is to open the appropriate  *.txt file for the common skill in the /resources/skills/ 
  directory&nbsp;(such  as weaponsmith.txt or pottery.txt) and noting the 
first  line of  the&nbsp;file.&nbsp; The first line in most cases will be 
a guide  to the number  and nature of the field values.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are properties of items, armor, weapons, and  containers that can 
   be modified by the Archon.&nbsp; If one wishes to modify a  dagger, one 
 must  either hold the dagger, or have the dagger present in the  room.&nbsp; 
 The  Archon can then issue the command "modify dagger".&nbsp; If the  item 
 is a GenItem, GenContainer, GenFood, GenWater, GenDrink, GenWeapon, or any 
  other  "Gen" item, then the same properties as above will be presented.&nbsp; 
   </p>
               
<p>Like rooms and areas, there are a very rich selection of  Behaviors you 
   may choose for items.&nbsp; Here are our favorites:</p>
               
<p>"Decay" for items that are only around for a limited  time.<br>

       "InstantDeath" to  cause an item to kill someone.<br>

<p><strong><font color="blue" size="5"><a name="xitems">Destroying  Items</a></font></strong></p>
               
<p>To destroy an item that is either being held by you, or  is in the same 
   room as you, you need only issue the destroy command.&nbsp; For  instance, 
   if a dagger has offended: "destroy item dagger" wll make it go  away.</p>
               
<p>Once destroyed, items that have been set to rejuv will  not do so.&nbsp; 
   If the item was a permanently saved item in the room, you must  re-save 
 the  room in order to make the items destruction permanent.</p>
               
<p><strong><font color="blue" size="5"><a name="arctools">Tools of the  Trade</a></font></strong></p>
               
<p>The Archons of your realm have lots of items that assist  them in building 
   and administering their mud.&nbsp; Lets take a look at  these:</p>
               
<p><em>The Archon Staff</em>&nbsp;  (CREATE ITEM ARCHONSTAFF) - the Archon 
   Staff is the main tool of the true  Archon.&nbsp; Also available from the
   OUTFIT command, it not only provides a  deadly weapon, but a useful source
   of magical power.&nbsp; To use the powers of  the staff, it must first
be   wielded.&nbsp; It is a two-handed item, so the  Archon's held position
must   be given up for it as well.&nbsp; Once wielded,  numerous magical
words invoke  the power: s<em>ay  targetname</em> <em>"refresh" </em>will 
rejuvinate the   targets mana, hit points, and movement; <em>sayto  targetname 
"level up"  </em>will give the target a free level of experience; <em>sayto 
targetname   "level all up" </em>will level the target  up to 91; <em>sayto 
targetname   "burn" </em>will blast the  target with hellish fire.</p>
               
<p><em>The Wand of the Archons</em>  (CREATE ITEM WANDARCHON) - the Wand of
the Archons is the one-handed alternative  to the Archon Staff.&nbsp; It
is also available only to true Archons.&nbsp; To  use the powers of the wand,
it must first be held. Once held, numerous magical  words invoke the power:
s<em>ay targetname</em> <em>"refresh" </em>will rejuvinate the targets mana,
hit  points, and movement; <em>sayto targetname "level up"  </em>will give
the target a free level of experience; <em>sayto targetname "level all up"
</em>will level the target  up to 91; <em>sayto targetname "burn" </em>will 
   blast the  target with hellish fire.</p>
               
<p><em>The Goody Bag </em>(CREATE ITEM  GOODYBAG) - The Goody Bag is full 
   of fabulous prizes which Archons may dispense  to players.&nbsp; What's 
 better,  an item that is removed is always replaced, so  that the bag never 
 runs out.&nbsp;  Inside the goody bad are piles of currency,  pills to gain 
 stats or experience,  and others goodies.</p>
               
<p><em>Ingredients&nbsp;Sack&nbsp;</em>(CREATE ITEM INGREDIENTS) -  The Ingredients 
   bag has exactly one of every kind of natural resource the system  offers.&nbsp; 
   Removing one from the bag will automatically replace it, so the  bag never 
   ever runs out.</p>
               
<p><strong><font color="blue" size="5"><a name="mobcreate">Creating  MOBs</a></font></strong></p>
               
<p>Greater even than the mages powerful spells of summoning  is the Archons 
   ability to conjure beasts into caverns and townspeople on to  streets.&nbsp; 
   To do this, the Archon need only issue the create command once  again.&nbsp; 
   Summoning a goblin into an ordinary room&nbsp;is as simple as  entering 
 "create  Goblin".&nbsp; This will create a standard Goblin in the room  you
 are standing  in.&nbsp; To make him stay there, even after you reboot, you
  must save the  room as described in the section below on saving rooms.</p>
               
<p>To find out what mobs are available for you to create,  you can enter "list
mobs".&nbsp; Entering "create &lt;mobname&gt;" will prove  the true incantation
for almost all of the creatures on this list.&nbsp; An  exception, however,
is the GenRideable.&nbsp; Since there is both an Item and  a&nbsp;MOB version
of that name, you will need to further qualify your create  command by entering
"create mob GenRideable" or "create item GenRideable".</p>
               
<p>If&nbsp;you wish to create your goblin a Grid-type  locale, extra consideration 
   is required.&nbsp; Locale types like MountainsGrid,  WoodsGrid, WoodsMaze, 
   PlainsGrid, DesertMaze, etc.. can all contain nasty  monsters in them.&nbsp; 
   However, two rules need to be followed for this magic to  work properly.&nbsp; 
   The first is that you can only save&nbsp;creatures which  are in the parent 
   Grid room itself.&nbsp; If you have SYSMSGS on, you can tell  which room 
  this is because it is the only one with a simple room ID  ("MyArea#123") 
 in the description.&nbsp;Since no one ever actually walks into  the parent 
 Grid room, the only way to get to it&nbsp;is using the Archon GOTO  command.&nbsp; 
   The second of the two rules is that you must give the mob a  Mobile behavior.&nbsp; 
   The mobile behaviors&nbsp;are specially coded so  that&nbsp;they will take
   the&nbsp;monster to a random room inside the grid the  first time the
thing    tries to move.&nbsp; </p>
               
<p><strong><a name="genm1"><font style="background-color: lime;">The "GenMob"&nbsp;and 
   "GenUndead"</font></a></strong></p>
               
<p>Whenever a GenMob&nbsp;or GenUndead is created, much  like the GenItem 
   above, you are presented with a list of properties to fill  in.&nbsp; Pressing
   enter will leave the property unchanged.&nbsp; The only  difference between
   the GenMob and GenUndead is that the GenUndead can  be&nbsp;TURNed by
a  Cleric,  while a GenMob cannot.&nbsp;&nbsp;The properties  include:</p>

<p><a name="genm2"><font style="background-color: lime;">The  "GenShopKeeper"</font></a></p>
       </strong>        
<p>ShopKeepers are folks that buy and sell equipement that  is given to them 
   by Archons.&nbsp; ShopKeepers can sell anything from items to  creatures, 
   skills as a teacher, or spells for a price.&nbsp; </p>
               
<p>ShopKeepers designated as Land Sellers will sell any  rooms in the same 
   area as the shopkeeper which has the Prop_RoomForSale,  Prop_RoomsForSale, 
   or Prop_LotsForSale properties.&nbsp; Use "AHELP  Prop_RoomForSale" for 
 more  information on this effect you may add to  rooms.&nbsp; ShopKeepers 
 designated  as Clan Land Sellers will do the same, but  only for Clan members.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
   In this way, players and clans can buy and  own their own rooms where their
   property will be safe during reboots, and pets  can become permanent fixtures.&nbsp;
   This is also the way the Construction,  Masonry, Locksmith, and other
property-related    skills can become useful.</p>
               
<p>ShopKeepers can also be Inn Keepers.&nbsp; To make this  work, you need 
   only give the shopkeeper a number of StdInnKey items equal to the  number 
   of rooms in your inn.&nbsp; For each room in your inn, make sure you have 
    a locked door for each room, and that each of the locked doors in your 
 inn  has a  key code equal to "INN1", "INN2", etc.. up to the number of locked
   doors for  each room in the Inn.&nbsp; Players will then buy the keys
to   rooms, and the  keys will automatically return to the shopkeepers stock
after  a single mud  "day".&nbsp; The only other trick to making a successful
inn  is to make sure you  do the "reset room" command to the room with the
innkeeper   in it, after the keys  have all been given to him, and the room
has been  saved.</p>
               
<p>ShopKeepers are much more savvy about money and economy  than most.&nbsp; 
   They will often draw not only from the loose gold a player has,  but any 
  high-denomination Notes the player has in his or her inventory.&nbsp;  The
  ShopKeeper will also give change in this manner.&nbsp; The player will often
   need to check the "change bag" newly arrived in their inventory to see
the   change that a ShopKeeper might have given them.&nbsp; These change
bags will  often contain the high-denomination notes mentioned before (such
as a Golden  Note, or a Half Note).&nbsp; Each of these notes are convertable 
 into loose gold  merely by GETting them from the change bag.&nbsp; </p>
               
<p>Whenever a GenShopKeeper is created, much like the  GenMob above, you are
presented with a list of properties to fill in.&nbsp;  Pressing enter will

      <p>this is where you would "stock" your shopkeeper        with items 
   that match their type.&nbsp; You may add to this list by        entering 
  the class names of any standard items, standard mobs, or        abilities.&nbsp; 
   You may also enter the name of any stray items or mobs        hanging out
   in the same room as the shopkeeper to put them up for        sale.&nbsp; 
  This last is the best and only way to get Generic items and        mobs 
onboard.&nbsp;         </p>
                                                               
      <p>When an item is put up for sale, you may specify        the number 
   of items like it the shopkeeper has in stock, and a price for        the 
  item.&nbsp; You may also specify a price for the        item.&nbsp;&nbsp;There 
  are many different values you can put in the price        field.&nbsp; 
     </p>
                                                               
      <p>* A given price of 0 or higher will ensure that        the item will
have that price in local currency.&nbsp; For example.&nbsp;        The price
is expressed in multiples of the the base value.&nbsp; A price        value
of 20 will mean that the item costs 20 gold to buy, before adjusting    
   for charisma and other factors, assuming gold is valued at 1.0 of    
   base.&nbsp; If the local currency has only Latinum Bars valued at 0.5,
       then a price value of 20 here would yield a 40 Latinum Bars price to
       consumers.<br>
       * A given price of -1 means that you        are allowing CoffeeMud 
to  price  the item for you.&nbsp; This should be the        recommended entry
 unless  you know what you are doing.<br>
       * A given price between -2 and -100, or -1000&nbsp;is        invalid!<br>
       * A given price between -101 and -999        will designate some number
   of Quest Points to charge for the item.&nbsp;        The number of quest
  points is determined by taking the absolute value of        your given
price   and subtracting 100.&nbsp; So a given price of -135 would       
mean that   the item costs 35 quest points.<br>
       * A        given price of -1001 or lower will designate some number
 of  Experience         Points to charge for the item.&nbsp; The number of
 experience  points  is        determined by taking the absolute value of
your given price  and         subtracting 1000.&nbsp; So a given price of
-1001 would mean that the item        costs 1 experience point, while a price
of -9876 would mean that the item        costs 8876 experience points.</p>

      <p>This complicated field is where you can adjust the        prices 
   the ShopKeeper sells from the programmed normal.&nbsp; It always works 
in tandem with the Devalue Rate below, as well as such factors as the Charisma 
 of the player dealing with your shopkeeper.<br>
       <br>
   An        unspecified   value here will always return a value of 1.0 (which 
 means NO        adjustment).&nbsp;   However, you may enter one or more adjustments
        separated by semicolons   (;).&nbsp; Here is an example:</p>

      <p>Each adjustment must begin with the words "SELL="        or "BUY=" 
   followed by a Real number designating the adjustment from        normal.&nbsp; 
   "SELL=" refers to the adjustment to prices players get when selling TO 
the shopkeeper. &nbsp;"BUY=" refers to the adjustment to prices players get 
when buying FROM the shopkeeper. &nbsp;A value above 1.0 for either of those 
will raise the applicable prices.&nbsp; A value below 1.0        (like   
0.3 or 0.75) will lower prices.&nbsp; Values of 0.0 are NOT        allowed.&nbsp; 
   If you need to all but not allow buying and selling, a        value of 
0.000000001   should do.&nbsp; </p>
                                                               
      <p>Each adjustment may also contain the name of one        or more Racial
Categories (Elf, Dwarf, Gnome, Halfing, etc..).&nbsp; If a        Racial
Category is specified, then the adjustment will ONLY apply to that      
 race.&nbsp; The adjustments are read from left to right, so adjustments 
      without any racial categories should be listed LAST.&nbsp; In the above
       example, Dwarves and Elves are given a very good deal, where everyone
else        gets a normal one.&nbsp; In addition to Racial Categories, you
may also        list alignments (good, neutral, or evil), a sex (male, female,
and        neuter), a character class, or the name of a faction range.&nbsp; 
   Remember        that this field is evaluated from left to right, so any 
 matches         made&nbsp;on the left that apply to a player will cancel 
evaluation  of the        rest of the field!&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
                                                               
      <p>Just as bonus feature, if the adjustment begins        with the words
"LIMIT=", then you may enter a number representing the        maximum number
of rows of inventory the shopkeeper will display whenever a        LIST is
done.&nbsp; If the adjustment begins with the words "RANGE=", then      
 you may enter either a number or a percentage. This number will represent 
          the maximum and minimum level range of the items which the shopkeeper 
   will        purchase from players. This level range is relative to the 
median   level        range of his area. For instance, if the median level 
of the  shopkeepers        area is 10, and RANGE=3 is entered, then the shopkeeper 
  will only purchase        items between levels 7 and 13. A value of 0 means 
  no limit and no range,        of course. These features have no relation 
 with the above        prejudice&nbsp;functionality -- they're just bonus.</p>

      <p>This field is used to define the maximum amount of        local currency,
per a defined time period, which shopkeepers will spend        when buying
equipment from players. The format of the field is an amount        of money
(in base values only) followed by the name of period (HOUR, DAY,        WEEK,
MONTH, YEAR). All of these time periods are **MUD** time periods,       
where one hour is about 10 minutes of real life time. For example, a value
       of "200 DAY" means that the shopkeeper will not buy more than 200
gold per        day of any equipment from players, assuming that gold=1.0
in currency        value. </p>

      <p>This field is used to limit the number of EACH        PARTICULAR 
   item that a shopkeeper will keep in his inventory. This        provides 
 a  ceiling therefore on the number of unique items of a kind which      
 a shopkeeper will purchase from players. The way this field works is by 
      defining how far the price drops, in percentage, every time the player 
         sells an item to a shopkeeper. Decimals (real numbers) are allowed 
  in this        field. This field may also be used to differentiate between 
  the rate of        devaluation of raw resources and other finished items. 
  A single integer        field would represent the devaluation percentage 
 of all items, while a        field with two integers seperated by a space 
 would represent the        devaluation of finished items and raw resources 
 respectively. For example,        a value of "20" would mean that the shopkeepers 
 value price drops by 20%        every time this shopkeeper buys a particular 
 item. If the shopkeeper buys        two, it would be 20%. Three would be 
60% and so forth. This effectively        limits the shopkeeper to buying 
to more than 5 of any item (5 * 20) ==        100%. A value of "20 0.5" would 
 mean a devaluation rate of 20% for        finished items, and 0.5% (1/2%) 
 for raw resources.<br>
         </p>
                       
      <p><br>
   By default, shopkeepers devalue at a rate of 20% and 0.2%, which is defined 
 in the coffeemud.ini file. &nbsp;If you want a particular shopkeeper to never
 devalue items, set the value of this field to 0 (meaning no devaluation).

<p><a name="genm5">The  "GenDeity"</a></p>
       </strong> </p>
             
<p>Deities are the employers of Clerics, and the object of  some players adoration
and worship.&nbsp; Deities are necessary for the DEITIES  command to work,
and add great role playing opportunities for all players,  though especially
Clerics, since only with deities does their Convert skill have  any meaning.&nbsp;
Since deities of this sort being attacked and killed can have  a negative
effect on game-play, it is important that deities be placed in a room  where
they will be save from players.&nbsp; Give the room where your deities are
 Prop_NoSummon and&nbsp;Prop_NoTeleport to keep&nbsp;mages from zapping deities
 in or out of their safe room.&nbsp;</p>
               
<p>There are a few important points to understand about  these supreme beings 
   before continueing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Deities may have separate  requirements 
 for  who may worship them, and who may be their clerics.&nbsp; You  will 
specify  these below.&nbsp; Deities may also have a list of blessings they 
 may bestow  upon their clerics and their non-cleric worshippers.&nbsp; When 
their  clerics  perform a special clerical ritual, the deity will give the 
cleric ALL of  his blessings.&nbsp; When a non-cleric worshipper performs 
the special  worshipper  ritual, the deity will give the worshipper one random 
blessing.&nbsp;  Leaving  these rituals blank prevents the deity from bestowing 
the proper  blessings.&nbsp;  You will specify all of these things below as
well.&nbsp;  Deities may also  have a list of curses that they bestow as
punishment for  sin.&nbsp; When  the clerics perform the cleric-specific sinful
ritual, the deity  will inflict  all of his curses upon the cleric.&nbsp;&nbsp;When 
  a non-cleric  worshipper  performs the worshipper-specific sinful ritual, 
  the deity will  inflict one  random curse upon the worshipper.&nbsp; Whether 
  these curses exist,  how many there are, and whether there are any sinful 
  rituals are all specified  below.&nbsp; The last point is about special 
clerical  powers.&nbsp; Deities may  give&nbsp;one of their&nbsp;clerics a
skill/spell/prayer/whatever  as a special  power after the cleric has performed 
the specified clerical  power ritual.&nbsp;  This power is taken away should 
the cleric ever rebuke  the deity.&nbsp; Whether  this power exists is specified 
below.</p>
               
<p>Whenever a GenDeity is created, much like the GenMob  above, you are presented 
   with a list of properties to fill in.&nbsp; Pressing  enter will leave 
the   property unchanged.&nbsp; The properties include all of the  fields 
listed   above under GenMob, plus&nbsp;a few more:</p>

<p>There are properties of&nbsp;mobs that can be modified  by the Archon.&nbsp; 
   If one wishes to modify a goblin,&nbsp;the&nbsp;goblin must  be&nbsp;present

<p><strong><font color="blue" size="5"><a name="xmobs">Destroying  MOBs</a></font></strong> 
   </p>
               
<p>To destroy a MOB&nbsp;that is in the same room as you,  you need only issue
the destroy command.&nbsp;&nbsp;If an orc, for instance, no  longer requires
his existence: "destroy mob orc" will take that existence  away.</p>
               
<p>Once destroyed, MOBs that have been set to rejuv will  not do so.&nbsp; 
   If the&nbsp;MOB was a permanently saved&nbsp;MOB in the room,  you must 
 re-save  the room in order to make the MOBs destruction permanent.</p>
               
<p><strong><font color="blue" size="5"><a name="eqmobs">Equipping  MOBs</a></font></strong></p>
               
<p>You may give a MOB equipment to wear or carry as  treasure, if this is 
   done properly.&nbsp; First off, you can ONLY equip a  Generic MOB.&nbsp; 
  This includes the GenMob, GenDeity, GenRideable, GenUndead,  GenBanker, 
and  GenShopKeeper.&nbsp; No other creature may be saved with  equipment.&nbsp; 
  Generic or non-Generic Items may be used as equipment.&nbsp;  </p>
               
<p>To equip the MOB, first create the items you wish to  give to your new 
   creature using the procedure described above under "Creating  Items".&nbsp; 
   Now, you may use the give command to put the item into the mobs  inventory, 
   and the dress command to make the mob wear it.</p>
               
<p>MOBs can also be equipped with variable  items.&nbsp;Variable items are&nbsp;items 
   which may or may not appear in its  inventory on any particular rejuvination 
   of the mob.&nbsp; Variable items  are&nbsp;created by modifying the Rejuv/Pct 
   field on the item in the mobs  inventory.&nbsp; If the value of this field 
   is less than 1 or greater than 99,  then the item will always appear in 
 the  inventory.&nbsp; If the value of the  field is between 1 and 100, then 
 it  represents the percent chance that the item  will remain in the inventory.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
   A special case is created when more  than one variable item is actually 
 being  worn in the same wear location on a  mob.&nbsp; In this special case, 
 CoffeeMud  will ensure that exactly one of the  variable items will remain.</p>
               
<p>Dealing with variable equipment can be very tricky when  not using the 
   MUDGrinder.&nbsp; It requires that the Archon remain in the room  with 
the   mob until the room is saved, in order to prevent the mob from ditching 
 its  equipment according to the variable rules.&nbsp; This is because the 
  variable  equipment rules will not activate so long as an Archon is in the
  room.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dealing  with variable equipment&nbsp;on MOBs also requires
 that  the Archon remember  to use the RESET ROOM command whenever returning
 to the room  to make modifications.&nbsp;  Only RESET ROOM will cause the
 mob to regain all of  his equipment with their  Rejuv/Pct fields intact.&nbsp;
 Forgetting to do a RESET  ROOM before making  modifications and saving the
 room can cause the Archon to  lose variable equipment.&nbsp; Lastly, the
Archon should take care not to make  copies of variable equipment on mobs
as room items.&nbsp; This is because the  Rejuv/Pct field that is used to
hold the percentage chance for the equipment  while it is in a mobs inventory
means something entirely different when the item  is saved in a room.&nbsp;
When an item is saved in a room, the Rejuv/Pct field  refers to the rejuvination
 (repopulation) rate for the item when it is removed  from a room.</p>

<p>Although the myriad of available races should be quite  sufficient for 
   any Archon's needs, you may find yourself at a point where a new  species 
   is required for the balance of your ecosystem.&nbsp; In this situation, 
  we must turn to the CREATE RACE command.&nbsp; Supposing we needed the raveging
    Woogler to grace our shores, we would enter:</p>
               
<p><strong>CREATE RACE  Woogler</strong></p>
               
<p>And it would be done.&nbsp; Whenever creating or  modifying a new race,

<p><strong><font color="blue" size="5"><a name="factions">Factions</a></font></strong></p>
               
<p>Before learning the secrets of creating, modifying, and  destroying factions, 
   needs must we delve into the topic of what a Faction  IS.&nbsp; A faction 
   can be viewed very simply as a glorified tattoo, where  instead of merely 
   having or not having the tattoo, a mob or player can have the  tattoo and
   have a numeric value assigned to that tattoo.&nbsp; Another way to  view
  a faction is as a relationship between a mob or player and some idea, such
   as Goodness, Evilness, Orc Affinity, Reputation, or some other idea.&nbsp; 
   For  example, in CoffeeMud, a mob or players Alignment is implemented as
  a  Faction.&nbsp; The Alignment can be thought of as having a tattoo called
    alignment along with a numeric value assigned to it.&nbsp; Alignment can
   also be  thought of as the relationship between the mob or player, and
evilness,    goodness, or neutrality.</p>
               
<p>The faction system in CoffeeMud is a powerful engine for  defining what 
   factions exist, how the factions are assigned, how the value of  factions 
   rise or fall in value, how value changes are reflected in other  factions, 
   and what impact the value of a faction has on experience gain, ability 
 usage,  and ability skill gain.&nbsp; Since the values of factions are  available&nbsp;for
  use in&nbsp;Properties such as Prop_WearZapper,  Prop_ReqEntry, and all
other  features which respect Zapper Masks, factions can  also potentially 
 impact  which items can be used, which rooms can be entered, the  price of
 goods,  the availability of Deities, and many other things as  well.&nbsp; 
 As an example, the alignment faction typically&nbsp;impacts all of  the things
 mentioned above and more.</p>
               
<p>Now, as was said before, factions have numeric  values.&nbsp; These values 
   can be positive, like 2389473, negative, or even  0.&nbsp; The range of 
 values  which are valid for a given faction are defined by  the limits of 
 the divisions  or Ranges of a faction.&nbsp; </p>
               
<p>A <strong>Range</strong> is a  numeric division of a faction you have defined.&nbsp;
A Range has a displayable  name, a special code name for use in Zapper Masks,
and of course a low and high  value.&nbsp; A Range can also be tied back
to CoffeeMud's built in "virtue  meter", which allows you to define a Range
as always granting the mob or player  whose faction value falls into that
range goodness, evilness, or  neutrality.&nbsp; The lowest value of the lowest
Range, and the highest value of  the highest Range define the overall limits
of the values of the faction  itself.&nbsp; No player or mob may have a value
for a faction which falls  outside those highest and lowest values of the
highest and lowest  Ranges.&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, ranges are the most
important part of a  faction.</p>
               
<p>Another important aspect are the range <strong>Change Triggers</strong>.&nbsp; 
   One of the ways factions  differ from simple tattoos is that CoffeeMud 
can   manage the rise and fall in the  values of the faction on a given mob 
or  player automatically.&nbsp; The way  these changes are triggered and managed
 is first through Change Triggers, which  are applied when both the source
 and target of an action have standing or value  in the faction, and when
the source and target are different creatures.&nbsp;  Each Change Trigger 
 defines 1) What triggers the change (the Trigger), 2)  Whether value is gained
 or lost in the faction when the trigger occurs (the  Direction), 3) What
percentage of the amount of change (after all other  modifiers) is applied
to the value (the Amount Factor),&nbsp; 4) several  miscellanous flags to
define the circumstances under which the trigger is  applied (the Flags),
and 5) a Zapper mask to determine what criteria the target  of the Trigger
must meet for this trigger to apply.&nbsp; The valid Triggers  include: Murder,
Time (a change occurs every 40 seconds or so), a type of skill  being used,
the domain of a spell being cast, a flag associated with a skill  being used,
or Add Outsider, which allows the faction to be added to those who  do not
have the faction, so long as they meet the other requirements.&nbsp;  Valid
Directions of change include: Up, Down, Opposite (opposite direction of 
the value of the creature killed and proportional in value to the distance 
 between the faction value&nbsp;in the source and the target), Minimum  (automatically 
gains minimum value), Maximum (automatically gains maximum  value), Add (gains 
the faction if they don't have it -- useful with the Add  Outsider trigger), 
Away (gain if monsters value for this faction is lower, lose  if higher), 
and Towards (gain if monsters value for this faction is higher, lose  if lower).&nbsp;
Valid Flags include: OUTSIDER, which allows the trigger to  apply even if
the target of the trigger (not the source) does not have standing  in this
faction, SELFOK, which allows the trigger to apply even when the source 
or target are the same person, and JUST100, which overrides the normal  modifications
of a change (based on experience or other factors) and uses 100  points as
a base amount for the change from this trigger.</p>
               
<p>Now, lets discuss how to list existing factions:</p>
               
<p><strong>LIST FACTIONS</strong></p>
               
<p>The list that is shown with this command reflects the  list of those factions 
   which have been loaded into CoffeeMuds memory.&nbsp;  Factions are loaded 
   into memory when their identifiers/filenames are added to  the FACTIONS 
 entry  in your "coffeemud.ini" file.&nbsp; Factions may also be  loaded if
 a mob  or player is loaded who has a faction which has already been  defined.&nbsp;
   Creating new factions, as you can now guess, is a two part  step.&nbsp;
 One  step is to add its identifier/filename to the FACTIONS entry of  your
 "coffeemud.ini"  file, after the file has been created. To create the new
  faction identifier/filename,  you must do the following:</p>
               
<p><strong>CREATE&nbsp;FACTION  orc_affinity.ini</strong></p>
               
<p>This command will create a new file in&nbsp;your  CoffeeMud/resources directory
or folder for the new faction.&nbsp; This file  will contain the default
setting for your brand new faction, whose ID  (identifier) will be ORC_AFFINITY.CMVars.&nbsp;
You will now be automatically  taken into the Faction Editor.&nbsp; If you
had wanted simply to modify an  existing faction, you might have entered:</p>
               
<p><strong>MODIFY FACTION  resources/reputation.ini</strong></p>
               
<p>The modify command will take you into the editor for an  existing faction, 
   regardless of whether it appears on the LIST FACTIONS list, so  long as 
 the  filename/identifier given refers to an existing faction file.&nbsp; 
 The Faction editor contains numerous other&nbsp;complex and interesting fields
 to change, which we will now describe.</p>

   Items and Mobs" or "How to Save a  Room"</a></font></strong></p>
               
<p>MOBs and Items that are created in rooms, even those  which have had the 
   Rejuv Ticks property set to some reasonable number, will not  actually 
begin   to rejuvenate, and will not reappear in the room when CoffeeMud  is
rebooted,   until the room is saved.&nbsp; </p>
               
<p>To save a room, you must be standing in it.&nbsp; From  there, you may 
   issue either the "save items" command to save the items in the  room, "save
   mobs" command to save the mobs in the room, or "save room" to save  them
  both.&nbsp; You should make sure that the items, mobs, or both, are exactly
   the way you want them to be when the system is rebooted.&nbsp; Players
in  the  room, including yourself and your followers, will be ignored by
the command to  save the mobs.</p>
               
<p>Currently, the resets using the Rejuv setting method are  on a mob-by-mob 
   and item-by-item basis, though the system does give you some  default reset
   times when mobs are created (based on level). There is an  alternative 
reset   method however.&nbsp; If you were to make NONE of your mobs or  items 
resettable   under the current scheme (by making the REJUV value 0), then 
 to&nbsp;add&nbsp;the   Behavior called "ResetWhole"&nbsp;to each&nbsp;Area, 
you  can simply reset   every room in the area on a timed basis.&nbsp;The 
behavior  will&nbsp;reset   every room after noone has visited the area in 
a certain amount  of time.   This time can be set in the behaviors parameters.&nbsp; 
Use AHELP  ResetWhole   for more information on this behavior. </p>

<p align="left"><u><strong><font>Weapon  Groups</font></strong></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
   </p>
               
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  When 
   building weapons, you must first select the group that the weapon falls 
  under.&nbsp; The weapon group affects which classes can use the weapon, 
as well  as what specializations enhance it&#8217;s use.&nbsp; Selecting more common
   weapon  groups, such as EDGED or SWORD can enable a weapon designer to
place   higher  level restrictions, if desired, on the weapon.&nbsp; This
increase   in levels is  suggested to be 2 additional levels, but not necessary
to keep  the game  balanced.&nbsp; Weapons within a group may deal any TYPE
of damage,  as discussed  later, but have general tendencies towards one
or two types.</p>
               
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Weapons 
   within a given category have certain general tendencies, as describe by 
  the table below.&nbsp; Any or all of these can be overridden for the purpose 
   of  weapon design, these are just the basic type of weapons in that category.&nbsp; 
    For example, flailed weapons tend to be unwieldy (have a negative to attack),
    but that doesn&#8217;t mean all flails are unwieldy.&nbsp; </p>
               
<p>Similarly, the allowed materials are materials used  historically to make 
   that type of weapon.&nbsp; If a weapon designer deigns to  make a weapon 
  out of LAMPOIL, it is doable, just a little unorthodox.&nbsp; (You  would 
  probably want to make the weapon out of GLASS, as that is the outer  delivery 
  devise of a Molotov Cocktail.)&nbsp; Currently, weapon SIZE has no  effect 
  on game play, but that may change at a later date.&nbsp; The BASE  MATERIAL 
  of a weapon assumes that weapons are made from that general area, and  use
  material bonuses based on that type.&nbsp; If you create a weapon out of
 a  non-standard, ALLOWABLE MATERIAL, use the appropriate charts for determining 
   attack and damage bonuses after the level has been set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Weapon 
   creation can be done by the designer fixing the DAMAGE that a weapon  does,
   or by fixing the LEVEL required to use the weapon.&nbsp; To generate 
weapons    that do a specific amount of damage which are balanced with the 
 WEAPONSMITHING    skills, use the following formula:</p>
               
<p>Level= ((2*D)/(H+1) + (A-W)/5 +R)*((R/W)+2)+1</p>
               
<p>where</p>
               
<p>D=base DAMAGE of the weapon before material  modifiers,<br>
       H=number of hands required to wield<br>
       A=base ATTACK bonus of the weapon<br>
       R=REACH/RANGE of weapon<br>
       W=WEIGHT of  weapon</p>
               
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Round 
   the final number down, to a minimum level of 1.&nbsp; Some general  criteria 
   to follow for weapons to avoid creating ultra-powerful, low-level  weapons 
   include:</p>
               
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Create 
   the weapon for a HUMAN-sized character first.&nbsp; If you wish to scale 
   it up or down for different races, use the WEAPONS FOR GIANTS table after 
    setting the base level.&nbsp; A typical one-handed human weapon will weigh
   from  1-8 pounds, and a two handed weapon will typically weigh from 10
to   20  pounds.&nbsp; Using heavier/lighter weapons will create a strange, 
and   possibly  unbalanced, result.</p>
               
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Melee 
   weapons should not have a reach greater than 1.</p>
               
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Weight 
   of weapons should include any incidental weight in using the item, such 
  as carrying case, ammunition, and other equipment generally assumed to be
  in use  with the item.&nbsp; For most RANGED weapons, this will add another
   4 pounds to  the typical weight of the weapon.&nbsp; For melee weapons,
 the  weight is  generally negligible.&nbsp; (Except, possibly for a Katana
 with  a very ornate  scabbard.)</p>
               
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Round 
   the final number down, to a minimum level of 1.</p>

    algebra and convert the equation into a damage equation to give you the 
   following formula:  </p>
             
<p>D= ((L-1)/((R/W)+2) + (W-A)/5 -R)*(((H*2)+1)/2)  </p>
             
<p>where  </p>
             
<p>L=Level required to use weapon,<br>
       H=number of hands required to wield<br>
       A=base ATTACK bonus of the weapon<br>
       R=REACH/RANGE of weapon<br>
       W=WEIGHT of  weapon  </p>
             
<p>Round the final number down, to a minimum level of  1.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  To 
   compute the weapon&#8217;s base value use the following equation:  </p>
             
<p>Cost of Item= 2*(W*V+(5*D+A+R*10)*D)/(H+1)  </p>
             
<p>where  </p>
             
<p>D=base DAMAGE of the weapon before material  modifiers,<br>
       H=number of hands required to wield<br>
       A=base ATTACK bonus of the weapon<br>
       R=REACH/RANGE of weapon<br>
       W=WEIGHT of  weapon<br>
       V=VALUE of the material the weapon is made from  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Weapon 
   Damage Type is entirely up to the weapon designer, but some guidelines 
 have  already been provided for the basic weapon types.&nbsp; Here is a brief
 description of the different damage types, and level modifiers for weapons
 with  these damage types:  </p>
             
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  NATURAL&#8212;All 
   Natural weapons should be UnGettable.&nbsp; Natural weapons are  available 
   for a creature to use in combat, such as a Manticore&#8217;s tail spikes;  but 
  not actual weapons for adventurer&#8217;s to loot.&nbsp; Any GETTABLE Natural 
 weapon  should have a level MODIFIER of at LEAST it&#8217;s DAMAGE rating.&nbsp; 
  Natural  weapons would be favored by monks if they could get them.  </p>
             
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  SLASHING&#8212;Slashing 
   weapons are fairly common and include things like Axes and  Swords.&nbsp; 
   No special care needs to be considered when making a weapon deal  SLASHING 
   damage.</p>
               
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  PIERCING&#8212;Piercing 
   weapons are very common amongst the Polearm groups.&nbsp; No  special care
   needs to be considered when making a weapon deal PIERCING  damage.</p>
               
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  BASHING&#8212;Bashing 
   weapons are common amongst Blunt and Hammer weapon groups.&nbsp;  No special 
   care needs to be considered when making a weapon deal SLASHING  damage.</p>
               
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  BURNING&#8212;This 
   is the damage type for all fire based attacks and spells.&nbsp;  Burning 
  weapons tend to do more damage to cloth and leather armors, and overall 
 are more powerful than Slashing/Piercing/Bashing due to there infrequent 
use  amongst weapons.&nbsp; Add 2 levels to a weapon&#8217;s base LEVEL if it is 
of type  BURNING.</p>
               
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  BURSTING&#8212; 
   This is the damage type for all Magic based attacks and spells.  Bursting 
   are more powerful than Slashing/Piercing/Bashing due to there  infrequent 
   use amongst weapons.&nbsp; Add 2 levels to a weapon&#8217;s base LEVEL if  it 
 is  of type BURSTING.</p>
               
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  SHOOT&#8212;This 
   is the damage type of projectile missiles, such as Bows and  Guns.&nbsp; 
  It is very similar in nature to PIERCING.&nbsp; No special care  needs to
  be considered when making a weapon deal SHOOT damage.</p>
               
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  FROSTING&#8212;This 
   is the damage type for all Cold based attacks and spells.&nbsp;  Frosting 
   weapons tend to be more powerful than Slashing/Piercing/Bashing due to 
 there  infrequent use amongst weapons.&nbsp; Add 2 levels to a weapon&#8217;s base
 LEVEL  if it is of type FROSTING.</p>
               
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  GASSING&#8212;This 
   is the damage type for all Gas based attacks and spells.&nbsp;  Gassing 
 weapons  tend to be more powerful than Slashing/Piercing/Bashing due to 
there infrequent  use amongst weapons.&nbsp; Add 2 levels to a weapon&#8217;s base
 LEVEL if it is  of type GASSING.</p>
               
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  MELTING&#8212;This 
   is the damage type for all Acid based attacks and spells.&nbsp;  Melting 
  weapons tend to do more damage to armors, and overall are more powerful 
 than Slashing/Piercing/Bashing due to there infrequent use amongst  weapons.&nbsp; 
  Add 2 levels to a weapon&#8217;s base LEVEL if it is of type  MELTING.</p>
               
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  STRIKING&#8212;This 
   is the damage type for all Electricity based attacks and  spells.&nbsp; 
 Striking  weapons tend to do more damage to cloth and leather  armors, and 
 overall are more powerful than Slashing/Piercing/Bashing due to  there infrequent 
  use amongst weapons.&nbsp; Add 2 levels to a weapon&#8217;s base  LEVEL if it 
is  of type STRIKING.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  If 
   you just want to guestimate a weapon&#8217;s level or damage, use the following 
    formulas.&nbsp; They aren&#8217;t very accurate, and can create radically overbalanced 
    weapons in the hands of players, but they are great for easy NON-GETTABLE 
   MOB  weapons.  </p>
             
<p>LEVEL=DAMAGE + (ATTACK/5)  </p>
             
<p>or</p>
               
<p>DAMAGE=LEVEL - (ATTACK/5)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  If 
   you wish to create weapons for large (or small) creatures, the weight of
  the  item will often get an unusually high bias, creating MASSIVE low level
  weapons  with lots of damage potential.&nbsp; Instead, create the weapon
 for a human  sized creature, and add the following modifiers.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Armor 
   creation is, in many ways, much simpler than weapon creation.&nbsp; There 
    are three types of armor: Cloth, Leather, and Metal.&nbsp; Strange armors 
   could  exist, but are variants of one of these three types.&nbsp; The armor
   values vary  by location, and by material.&nbsp; Shields are considered 
 to  be HELD METAL  armor.&nbsp; For a wooden shield, consider it as a HELD 
 LEATHER  armor for  the&nbsp;purposes of&nbsp;further discussion&nbsp;(though 
 your  material would  still be WOODEN).  </p>
             
<p><u><strong><font style="background-color: lightgrey;">Armor Points (Not 
   the final Defensive value of the  armor)</font></strong></u>  </p>
             
<p> </p>
             
<p></p>
               
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Different 
   types of armor have different level values, since the less armored  classes 
   would love to get that extra armor bonus at a lighter weight.&nbsp; To 
 keep  the classes balanced, the use the following guideline for determining 
 the   BASE POINT value of an armor piece.&nbsp; As you will see in the next 
 section,   different WEAR locations will have different ARMOR VALUEs for 
the same type  of  armor.&nbsp; A platemail breastplate is more protective 
than a platemail  cuff.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;The armor weights are recommendations.&nbsp; If  you wish to create 
   a lighter version of chain mail that gives the same armor  protection (like
   Elven Chainmail) go right ahead.&nbsp; It will not increase the  level,
 it  will increase the COST of the armor.</p>
               
<p><u><strong><font style="background-color: lightgrey;">Armor Cost</font></strong></u> 
    </p>
             
<p> </p>
             
<p></p>
               
<p>The formula for the cost of the armor is:  </p>
             
<p>COST = (A*A + V) * ( W/2)  </p>
             
<p>where</p>
               
<p>W = Weight of Armor<br>
       A&nbsp; =  Armor Points<br>
       V = material Value</p>
               
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  So 
   our example of an iron Banded Shirt would cost 2173.5 (round up to 2174): 
    (7*7+20)*(63/2).  </p>
             
<p> </p>

<p></p>
               
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  After 
   you have computed the Armor Value, consult the materials tables for any 
  bonuses that the material may give.&nbsp; This number is a bonus per Armor
    Point.&nbsp; If a breast plate of full plate is made from Adamantite
(armor     bonus of 4), it would gain 12 (4*3) points of protection, bringing
it&#8217;s   total  value from 30 (10*3) to 42. (30 + 12).&nbsp; Material modifiers
do   NOT affect  the level of the armor, even though it would have an effective
  Armor Point total  of 14, it would still be available at level 23!&nbsp;
 Consult the Material  Modifiers section below for an Armor Point reference.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Magic 
   should be controlled by the type of MUD that is being run.&nbsp; If you 
  run a low-fantasy MUD, you may wish to increase the Level requirement for
   items  with magical properties.&nbsp; If you are on a high-fantasy MUD,
 you  may wish to  decrease the Level requirements for items with magical
properties.&nbsp;  Magic  comes in at least seven forms:&nbsp; Magic Adjustment,
<em>PropFightSpellCast,  PropHaveSpellCast, PropWearSpellCast,  PropHaveAdjustor,
PropWearAdjuster,  PropHaveResistor, PropWearResistor</em>.  </p>
             
<p><u><strong><font style="background-color: yellow;">Magic Adjustment</font></strong></u>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This 
   field is available on any item, weapon or armor.&nbsp; If the item can 
be    worn (but not used as a weapon), then every point of magic gives 1 point
  of  Armor Value.&nbsp; If the item can be used as a weapon, then it gives
  +2 to  Damage, and +10 to Attack per point of bonus.&nbsp; In either case,
  the magic  adjustment improves the item&#8217;s saving throws against attacks
that  damage it&#8217;s  condition.&nbsp; Having a Magic Adjustment greater than
0 makes  the item magical  (and detectable as such).&nbsp; Every 1 point of
magic adjustment is worth 5  additional levels to the base level of the item.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This 
   property will make a weapon discharge a spell-effect with each successful 
    hit.&nbsp; As such, it is very powerful, and the weapon&#8217;s level should 
 be   increased by twice the spell&#8217;s typical level.&nbsp; As with all spell 
 effects,   use careful judgment when placing spells on items, and use your 
 own discretion   for determining the final level adjustment.  </p>
             
<p><em>PropHaveSpellCast</em>  </p>

<p></p>
               
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  By 
   simply having this item, the designated spell is cast on the owner.&nbsp; 
   If  this is a positive effect, add the Spell effect&#8217;s typical level to 
the   level of  the item (at least, depending on usefulness).&nbsp; If having 
 a  stone of  Invisibility (level 7) is enough to make you invisible, then 
 the  stone should  require at least a level 7 character (if it did nothing 
 else).&nbsp;  On  something as powerful as invisibility, you may wish to 
increase the level  even  more.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This 
   property makes any worn/wielded item grant the effects of a spell.&nbsp; 
  As  a general rule, the item&#8217;s level should be increased by half of the 
spell&#8217;s    typical level.&nbsp; Again, use your own discretion when creating 
items  that may  be very powerful, such as stoneskin or invisibility.  </p>
             
<p><em>PropHaveAdjustor</em>  </p>

<p></p>
               
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This 
   property makes an item that is in a MOBs possession gain certain  abilities.&nbsp; 
   This is a very powerful effect, since a MOB could conceivably  carry a 
lot   of these items.&nbsp; The level increase for items of this type  should 
 be  at least twice as high as those with the PropWearAdjustor effect.  </p>
             
<p><em>PropWearAdjustor</em>  </p>
             
<p> </p>
             
<p></p>
               
<p>This property makes a worn/wielded item grant special  benefits to it&#8217;s 
   owner.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  There 
   are many properties available in Coffeemud that enable unique item  creation.&nbsp; 
   There are inhibiting properties such as the <em>PropWearZapper</em> and 
 <em>PropHaveZapper</em>  that can be used to reduce the level of  the item 
 (I would say as a general  rule, for every race restricted, reduce the  level
 requirement by 2, and for every class restricted reduce the level by  1.)&nbsp;
 Other spell effects  may be negative, reducing the value of the  item.&nbsp;
 Still others may be difficult to determine their effects, reducing  the
value  of the item.&nbsp;  Use your judgment, or request the system owner&#8217;s
 advice  for particularly  complicated works of magic. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  For 
   determining the added monetary value of an item based on its magical  properties,
   you must first determine how prevelant magic items will be in your  world.
   Choose a cost Index between *10 for a magic rich world, to *100 for a
 magic   poor world. Each level above the base level is multiplied by this
Index  and then added to the base cost to determine its final value.</p>
               
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Final Cost = Base Cost + (Total Level Increase)*(cost Index)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The 
   Material that you use to create an item affects it&#8217;s overall effectiveness 
    without affecting it&#8217;s level.&nbsp; Make these modifications to the item 
   AFTER  completing the previous formulas.&nbsp; If you use a non-standard 
  material, do  not apply the actual material modifiers (other than value) 
 to the item&#8217;s Attack,  Damage, or Armor values.&nbsp; A metal club is superior 
  to a wooden club, but  using a better type of metal doesn&#8217;t increase the 
 bluntness (or even relative  hardness) of the club significantly.&nbsp; ROCK
 is an exception to this  rule.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Once 
   an item is completed, add any values from materials to the end result to
   get the final values for the item.&nbsp; Note that CONDITION is a relative 
   term  that determines ARMOR and WEAPON damage condition.&nbsp; Different 
  types of  materials suffer differently from the various attack forms.&nbsp; 
  A blank in  this area means that it resists damage normally, and wears at
  the standard rate  for all attacks against that type of material.&nbsp; 
A  &#8216;+&#8217; means that it holds  up better against all forms of attacks.&nbsp; 
A &#8216;-&#8216; means that it suffers more  damage from all forms of attacks.&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Mithril 
   is a special type of METAL.&nbsp; Therefore, any item that can be made 
 from  a metal, can also be made from a mithril.&nbsp; Mithril has different 
  resistance  scores than metals, and has other special properties, so it 
is listed  as  its own classification.</p>
               
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  If 
   an item is created from a non-standard material, apply those modifiers 
 FIRST.&nbsp;  If they don&#8217;t allow for a MATERIAL MODIFIER, then skip this 
  step.</p>

<p>Quests are tasks which can be completed by players for  prizes, typically 
   quest points, experience, money, or all three.&nbsp; Quest  tasks, the 
monitoring   of their completion and status, as well as their  availability, 
can all be  automated by CoffeeMud. </p>
               
<p>A quest is created by an Archon using the <strong>CREATE QUEST</strong> 
   [SCRIPT] command from the command  line. Where [SCRIPT] is a either a complete
   quest script, where each command  line is terminated by a semicolon (;),
  or a load command of the form  LOAD=[SCRIPT PATH]. An example of a create
  script using a load command is as  follows:</p>
               
<p><strong>CREATE QUEST</strong>  LOAD=c:/temp/myquest.txt</p>
               
<p>To load one of the built-in quests, for instance,  use:</p>
               
<p><strong>CREATE QUEST</strong>  LOAD=quests/robbed/robbed.quest</p>
               
<p>Quests may be&nbsp;started automatically (autoquests)  from inside the 
   quest script by including&nbsp;the SET WAIT and SET INTERVAL  commands, 
 or  they&nbsp;may be started manually by using the <strong>MODIFY QUEST</strong> 
   [QUEST NAME] command. </p>
               
<p>Quests can be listed, to see their status, using the  <strong>LIST QUESTS</strong> 
   command. </p>
               
<p>Quests can be removed from the list using the <strong>DESTROY QUEST</strong> 
   [QUEST NAME] command.</p>
               
<p>Quests can be saved using the <strong>SAVE QUESTS</strong> command. Quests 
   saved this way will be  restored during the next CoffeeMud reboot. </p>
               
<p><font style="background-color: aquamarine;" color="#4169e1" size="4"><strong>Quest 
    Scripts</strong></font></p>
               
<p>When creating a new quest using the <strong>CREATE QUEST</strong> [SCRIPT] 
   command, whether you use the  load command to specify an external script, 
   or include the script directly into  the create command, the quest script 
   commands are as follows:</p>
               
<p>SET NAME [QUEST NAME] - the *unique* name of your quest.  This is a required 
   command! </p>
               
<p>SET DURATION [#TICKS] - # of ticks (4 second periods)  the quest will last
once started. This is a required command! </p>
               
<p>SET WAIT [#TICKS] - minimum # ticks to wait between  auto-starts of the 
   quest. Required for auto-quests only! </p>
               
<p>SET DATE [DAY]-[MONTH] - The real-life start-date of the  quest. This is
a valid substitute for the SET WAIT requirement.</p>
               
<p>SET MUDDAY [DAY]-[MONTH] - The start mud-date of the  quest, according 
   to the default global mud calendar. This is a valid substitute  for the 
 SET  WAIT requirement.</p>
               
<p>SET WAIT [#TICKS] - minimum # ticks to wait between  auto-starts of the 
   quest. Required for auto-quests only! </p>
               
<p>SET INTERVAL [#TICKS] - random # ticks (1-#TICKS) to  wait between auto-starting 
   the quest, AFTER the WAIT period (see above) is over.  Required for auto-quests! 
   </p>
               
<p>SET MINPLAYERS [#PLAYERS] - Minimum number of players who must be online
   for a timed quest to automatically start. See SET PLAYERMASK.</p>
           
<p>SET PLAYERMASK [MASKSTRING] - If this string is empty or not specified,
   then anyone is considered a player for the purposes of the MINPLAYERS
setting    above. However, you can specify a "zapper mask" to narrow down
the definition    of a player. &nbsp;See HELP Prop_HaveZapper for the list
of valid mask values   to put here.</p>
           
<p>SET RUNLEVEL [#LEVEL] - Normally, a timed quest will always run when its 
  time comes up. &nbsp;Setting a value above -1 will prevent this quest from 
  running when its time comes up if another quest is also running at the same
  or LOWER run level.</p>
           
<p>IMPORT MOBS [XML FILE PATH] - this will import a list of  custom mobs from
a .CMARE file generated using the EXPORT ROOM MOBS command. The  parameter 
   must be the path and file name of the file. </p>
               
<p>IMPORT ITEMS [XML FILE PATH] - this will import a list  of custom items 
   from a .CMARE file generated using the EXPORT ROOM ITEMS  command. The 
parameter   must be the path and file name of the file. </p>
               
<p>SET AREA ([AREA NAME OR NAMES]) - will set the current  designated area 
   to the area specified. Although this does nothing in itself, it  is important 
   for the several commands which load mobs and items. The area name  ANY 
may   be given to choose a random area.&nbsp;Several area names may be  specified 
   as choices by setting the first area name as ANY, followed by your  other 
   area name&nbsp;choices, separated by spaces.&nbsp;If no area name is  given,
   this will CLEAR the area designation. This can have a profound impact
on    how subsequent mob or item loading, or room setting commands work.
</p>
               
<p>SET ROOM ([ROOM NAME]) - will set the current designated  room to the one
specified. If a room or area has been previously designated, and  not cleared
(see SET AREA), then the room will be selected from the designated  area
according to the room name criteria. Otherwise, a room from the whole map
 will be chosen. If a room name of ANY is given, then the room will be chosen
 randomly from the world, or the area if designated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Several room
 names may be specified as choices by setting the first room name as ANY,
 followed by your other room name&nbsp;choices, separated by spaces.&nbsp; 
   If no  room name is given, this will effectly clear the room designation 
  (but it will  not clear the area designation!). </p>
               
<p>SET LOCALE ([LOCALE]) - will set the current designated  room to the one 
   with the specified class name. If a room or area has been  previously designated,
   and not cleared (see SET AREA), then the room will be  selected from the
  designated area according to the locale criteria. Otherwise, a  room from
  the whole map will be chosen. If a locale of ANY is given, then the  room
  will be chosen randomly from the world, or the area if  designated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Several 
  locale types may be specified as choices by  setting the first locale type 
  as ANY, followed by your other locale type  choices, separated by spaces.&nbsp; 
  If no locale is given, this will effectly  clear the room designation (but 
  it will not clear the area designation!). </p>
               
<p>SET MOBGROUP ([MOB NAME]) - will designate a set of mobs  with the given 
   name. If the name ends with MASK=..., then a mask similar in  functionality 
   to the one described in the Prop_HaveZapper will apply in addition  to 
the   name mask entered. The mobs chosen will be selected from those in the 
 designated   area (if one was designated) or the world. The mobs must exist 
  somewhere   in the map for this command to work. </p>
               
<p>SET MOB ([MOB NAME]) - will set the current mob to one  with the given 
   name. If the name ends with MASK=..., then a mask similar in  functionality 
   to the one described in the Prop_HaveZapper will apply in addition  to 
the   name mask entered. Ths mob chosen will be selected from a MOBGROUP if
one    has been set. Otherwise, the mob chosen will be selected from those 
in the   designated area (if one was designated) or the world. The mob must 
exist   somewhere in the map for this command to work. If a room has been 
previously   designated, then this command will bring the mob to that room. 
If a room  or area  has not been designated (or was cleared), then this command 
will  designate a new  room and area. </p>
               
<p>SET MOBTYPE ([CLASS]) - will set the current mob to one  with the given 
   class name. Ths mob chosen will be selected from a MOBGROUP if  one has 
 been  set. Otherwise, the mob chosen will be selected from those in the 
designated  area (if one was designated) or the world. The mob must exist 
 somewhere in the map for this command to work. If a room has been previously 
 designated,  then this command will bring the mob to that room. If a room 
or area  has  not been designated (or was cleared), then this command will 
designate a new  room and area. </p>
               
<p>SET ITEM ([ITEM NAME]) - will set the current item to  one with the given 
   name. The item chosen will be selected from those in the  designated area 
   (if one was designated) or the world. The item must exist  somewhere in 
 a  room on the map for this command to work. If a room has been  previously 
  designated, then this command will bring the item to that room. If a  room 
  or area has not been designated (or was cleared), then this command will 
  designate a new room and area. </p>
               
<p>SET ITEMTYPE ([CLASS]) - will set the current item to  one with the given 
   class name. The item chosen will be selected from those in  the designated 
   area (if one was designated) or the world. The item must exist  somewhere 
   in a room on the map for this command to work. If a room has been  previously 
   designated, then this command will bring the item to that room. If a  room
   or area has not been designated (or was cleared), then this command will
   designate a new room and area. </p>
               
<p>LOAD MOB [MOB NAME] - will instantiate a mob of the  given name from the 
   list of mobs imported using the IMPORT MOBS command above.  If the name 
 ends  with MASK=..., then a mask similar in functionality to the one  described 
   in the Prop_HaveZapper will apply in addition to the name mask  entered. 
  This selected mob will be set as the current mob. If a room has been  previously 
   designated, then this command will create the mob in that room. If a  room
   or area has not been designated (or was cleared), then this command will
   designate a random room and area. </p>
               
<p>LOAD ITEM [ITEM NAME] - will instantiate an item of the  given name from 
   the list of items imported using the IMPORT ITEMS command above.  This 
item   will be set as the current item. If a room has been previously  designated, 
   then this command will create the item in that room. If a room or  area 
 has  not been designated (or was cleared), then this command will designate 
  a  random room and area. GIVE ITEM - will give the currently designated 
item   (designated using the SET ITEM, or LOAD ITEM command) to the currently 
 designated mob (designated using the SET MOB, or LOAD MOB command). </p>
               
<p>GIVE BEHAVIOR [BEHAVIOR ID] [PARAMETERS] - The behavior  ID must be a valid
behavior class name. The parameters are any parameters you  wish to pass
to the behavior. This command will give the currently designated  mob, item,
or mobgroup (designated using the set or load commands) the above  behavior.
 GIVE ABILITY [ABILITY ID] [PARAMETERS] - The ability ID must be a  valid
ability class name. The parameters are any parameters you wish to pass to
 the ability. This command will give the currently designated mob, or mobgroup
 (designated using the set or load commands) the above ability. </p>
               
<p>GIVE AFFECT [ABILITY ID] [PARAMETERS] - The ability ID  must be a valid 
   ability class name. The parameters are any parameters you wish  to pass 
 to  the ability. This command will give the currently designated mob,  item, 
  or mobgroup (designated using the set or load commands) the above affect. 
   </p>
               
<p>GIVE FOLLOWER [MOB NAME] - The mob name is a mob which  will be selected 
   from the list of previously designated mobs (designated using  the load 
 or  set mob commands). This mob will be made into a follower of the  CURRENTLY 
   designated mob. This command does not change the current mob  designation, 
   nor does it change the location of either mob.</p>
               
<p>RESET&nbsp;- If a room has been set, this command will  cause that room 
   to reset, or re-load from the database.&nbsp; If a room has not  been set,
   but an area has been set, this command will cause all rooms in that  area
   to reload from the database.&nbsp; Doing either can be somewhat time 
consuming,    and may disrupt any players in the rooms affected, as it will
cause  items    to vanish from the floor, and make players and mobs unable
to move until    the process is completed.</p>
               
<p>&lt;SCRIPT&gt; - This designates the beginning of  embedded Javascript

which   mobs and items were selected by the SET commands as described  above 
(<font face="Courier New" size="2">isQuestObject,  getQuestObject, getQuestMob,

   made available by  this method contains information on the current state

<p class="MsoNormal"><a name="appe"><strong><font color="#008000"
 size="5">Appendix E: Socials</font></strong></a></p>
               
<p>Socials are those miscellaneous and happy little emoting  blurbs that help
make muds a more fun and realistic place for players to  interact.&nbsp; Without
them, players couldn't smile, roll their eyes, or flip  anyone off without
considerable typing.&nbsp; The command line includes a social  creator and
editor:</p>
               
<p><strong><font style="background-color: moccasin;">CREATE SOCIAL  TWIGGLE</font></strong><br>
       <br>
       This  starts the creation process for a social called TWIGGLE.&nbsp; 
 There   are  actually four different kinds of TWIGGLE we will make: TWIGGLE 
 (no parameters),   TWIGGLE SELF, TWIGGLE ALL, and TWIGGLE (to&nbsp;a target).&nbsp; 
 This is  type 1  of 4.<br>
       <br>
       <em>You wave your arms...<br>
       Social name  'TWIGGLE' Enter new.<br>
       :&nbsp;<br>
       </em><br>
       This is here in case you want  to change the social name before you
 create   it. Doubtful, so just hit ENTER and  skip it.<br>
       <br>
       <em>(No change)<br>
       Target=NONE<br>
       Change T)arget, S)elf, A)ll, or N)one:&nbsp;</em><br>
       <br>
       This is where you choose the  social type. For type1 socials, this 
would    be None.<br>
       <br>
       <em>(No change)<br>
       You see 'null'.&nbsp; Enter new.<br>
       :  <br>
       </em><br>
       This is what you as a  player would see when you perform the social.<br>
       <br>
       <strong>You wiggle your  toes.</strong><br>
       <br>
       <em>Your action type=MOVEMENT<br>
       Change  W)ords, M)ovement (small), S)ound, L)arge Movement&nbsp;<br>
       </em><br>
       This is the requirement of  the social. Small movement just needs
hands,    fingers, toes, lips, and other  small body movements, while large
movements    require legs, and often moving the  entire body. I tend to not
use the Words   one, and I leave sounds for, well,  yelling and such. This
particular social   involves toes, thus it's a M)ovement.  Type "<strong>M</strong>" 
for that.</p>
               
<p><em>Others see 'null'.&nbsp; Enter  new.<br>
       :&nbsp;<br>
       </em><br>
       This is what the people in the room see when you perform a  social.<br>
       <br>
       <strong>&lt;S-NAME&gt; wiggles &lt;S-HIS-HER&gt; toes.</strong><br>
       <br>
       &lt;S-NAME&gt; means Source Name.  Character performing the social 
is  the  source. I'll have a list of usable tags  at the end of this tutorial
  for you.<br>
       <br>
       <strong>Others Effect type=HANDS<br>
       Change W)ords, M)ovement (w/noise), S)ound, V)isual,  H)ands:&nbsp;<br>
       </strong><br>
       This is  what others in the room need to be able to know you're performing 
   a social. This  social involves toe wiggling, so I would recommend Visual. 
   If you're curious  about Hands, that would be left for handshakes, highfives, 
   etc.&nbsp;</p>
               
<p>And that concludes the creation of our TWIGGLE social,  type 1.<br>
       <br>
       <strong><font style="background-color: moccasin;">CREATE SOCIAL TWIGGLE
   SELF</font></strong><br>
       <br>
       Ahh. Part 2, the SELF portion.<br>
       <br>
       <em>You wave  your arms...<br>
       Social name 'TWIGGLE' Enter new.<br>
       : <br>
       </em><br>
       Like the above, you don't need to change the name.<br>
       <br>
       <em>(No  change)<br>
       Target=NONE<br>
       Change  T)arget, S)elf, A)ll, or N)one:&nbsp;<br>
       </em><br>
       Because this portion is the SELF portion, choose "<strong>S</strong>". 
  <br>
       <br>
       <em>You see 'null'.&nbsp; Enter  new.<br>
       : <br>
       </em><br>
       This is what you see when you perform the social TWIGGLE  SELF.<br>
       <br>
       <strong>You glaze over while you try to wiggle your toes at  yourself.</strong><br>
       <br>
       <em>Your action type=MOVEMENT<br>
       Change  W)ords, M)ovement (small), S)ound, L)arge Movement<br>
       </em><br>
       You need toes to wiggle them,  right? <strong>M</strong>)ovement for 
 that.   <br>
       <br>
       <em>Others  see 'null'.&nbsp; Enter new.<br>
       :<br>
       </em><br>
       What the others in the room  see when you perform the social.<br>
       <br>
       <strong>&lt;S-NAME&gt; wiggles  &lt;S-HIS-HER&gt; toes at &lt;S-HIM-HERSELF&gt;. 
   Very odd.<br>
       </strong><br>
       <em>Others Effect type=HANDS<br>
       Change  W)ords, M)ovement (w/noise), S)ound, V)isual, H)ands:<br>
       </em><br>
       They need to see it happen,  right? I would guess it's a <strong>V</strong>)isual 
    requirement.</p>
               
<p>And that concludes the creation of our type 2 TWIGGLE  social.</p>
               
<p><strong><font style="background-color: moccasin;">CREATE SOCIAL TWIGGLE 
    ALL</font><br>
       </strong><br>
       Yay!&nbsp;Type 3! The ALL is the Target Name.<br>
       <br>
       <em>You wave  your arms...<br>
       Social name 'TWIGGLE' Enter new.<br>
       : <br>
       </em><br>
       I  doubt you would still need to change the name. You have type one
 and   two. Why  make 3 different?<br>
       <br>
       <em>(No change)<br>
       Target=NONE<br>
       Change T)arget, S)elf, A)ll, or N)one:<br>
       </em><br>
       It's the ALL portion of  social creation, so choose "<strong>A</strong>".<br>
       <br>
       <em>You see  'null'.&nbsp; Enter new.<br>
       :<br>
       </em><br>
       What you would see when you  perform TWIGGLE [Target] (ex: TWIGGLE 
VIRAX).<br>
       <br>
       <strong>You wiggle your toes at  everyone. How wierd.</strong><br>
       <br>
       The display would replace the tag with the appropriate  name, and
in  this   example it would be Virax.<br>
       <br>
       <em>Your action type=MOVEMENT<br>
       Change W)ords, M)ovement (small), S)ound, L)arge  Movement<br>
       </em><br>
       We have toes  we'll need to wiggle. <strong>M</strong>)ovement.<br>
       <br>
       <em>Others  see 'null'.&nbsp; Enter new.<br>
       :<br>
       </em><br>
       What those&nbsp;twiggled at  people&nbsp;witness.<br>
       <br>
       <strong>&lt;S-NAME&gt; wiggles &lt;S-HIS-HER&gt; toes at everyone. 
 Very   strange.</strong><br>
       <br>
       <em>Others Effect type=HANDS<br>
       Change  W)ords, M)ovement (w/noise), S)ound, V)isual, H)ands:<br>
       </em><br>
       I'd say another thing they  would have to see. Don't you? <strong>V</strong>)isual.<br>
       <br>
       <strong><font style="background-color: moccasin;">CREATE SOCIAL TWIGGLE
    &lt;T-NAME&gt;</font><br>
       <br>
       </strong>Yay!&nbsp;Type 4! The TARGET! &lt;T-NAME&gt; is  the Target 
 Name.<br>
       <br>
       <em>You wave your arms...<br>
       Social name  'TWIGGLE' Enter new.<br>
       : <br>
       </em><br>
       I doubt you would still need to change the name. You have  type one, 
 two,   and three. Why make&nbsp;4 different?<br>
       <br>
       <em>(No change)<br>
       Target=NONE<br>
       Change T)arget, S)elf,  A)ll, or N)one:<br>
       </em><br>
       It's the  TARGET portion of social creation, so choose "<strong>T</strong>".<br>
       <br>
       <em>You see 'null'.&nbsp; Enter  new.<br>
       :<br>
       </em><br>
       What you would see when you perform TWIGGLE [Target] (ex:  TWIGGLE 
VIRAX).<br>
       <br>
       <strong>You wiggle your toes at &lt;T-NAME&gt;. How  cute.</strong><br>
       <br>
       The display  would replace the tag with the appropriate name, and
in  this   example it would be  Virax.<br>
       <br>
       <em>Your action type=MOVEMENT<br>
       Change  W)ords, M)ovement (small), S)ound, L)arge Movement<br>
       </em><br>
       We have toes we'll need to  wiggle. <strong>M</strong>)ovement.<br>
       <br>
       <em>Others  see 'null'.&nbsp; Enter new.<br>
       :<br>
       </em><br>
       What those bystanders  witness.<br>
       <br>
       <strong>&lt;S-NAME&gt; wiggles &lt;S-HIS-HER&gt; toes at  &lt;T-NAME&gt;. 
   Very strange.</strong><br>
       <br>
       <em>Others Effect type=HANDS<br>
       Change W)ords, M)ovement (w/noise), S)ound, V)isual,  H)ands:<br>
       </em><br>
       I'd say another  thing they would have to see. Don't you? <strong>V</strong>)isual.<br>
       <br>
       <em>Target sees 'null'.&nbsp; Enter  new.<br>
       :<br>
       </em><br>
       If you were the unfortunate victim, this is what you would  see.<br>
       <br>
       <strong>&lt;S-NAME&gt; wiggles &lt;S-HIS-HER&gt; toes at  you.</strong><br>
       <br>
       <em>Target Effect type=HEARING NOISE<br>
       Change W)ords, M)ovement (w/noise), S)ound, V)isual,  H)ands:<br>
       </em><br>
       You see them  wiggling their toes, so this would also be <strong>V</strong>)isual.<br>
       <br>
       <em>You see when no target  'null'.&nbsp; Enter new.<br>
       :<br>
       </em><br>
       This is what you would see if  the target you want to use the social 
 against   isn't there.<br>
       <br>
       <strong>Sorry. They aren't here for that lovely toe  wiggle.</strong><br>
       <br>
       This concludes  the social creation process. Enjoy creating your own 
 socials,   folks! To modify  an existing social, purely use MODIFY SOCIAL 
 [NAME] (i.e.   MODIFY SOCIAL BONK,  MODIFY SOCIAL HIGHFIVE &lt;T-NAME&gt;) 
 or even MODIFY   SOCIAL PAT SELF) What this  does is it goes through the 
command list like   you are creating that particular  social, but with the 
information that is  already stored on it. What you can do  is just hit ENTER 
until you get to  the part of the social you want to change and  change it 
accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="appg"><strong><font color="#008000" size="5">Appendix G:  The 
   CoffeeMud File System (CMFS)</font></strong></a>&nbsp;</p>
               
<p>This is a complicated topic, but one that all builders  and Archons should 
   understand.&nbsp; Sooner or later, every CoffeeMud  adminstrator is going 
   to want to modify some of the local files in the CoffeeMud  folder.&nbsp; 
   This may include the quests, or skill lists, or hopefully the  intro.txt 
  file located in resources/text directory!&nbsp; Builders will also  want 
 to add files, including MOBPROG script files that run in the Scriptable 
behavior,  item and mob CMARE files for the RandomMobs behavior or for other 
 scripts,  Quest scripts, and other things.&nbsp; </p>
               
<p>Pretty soon, your directories are packed with stuff customized to your 
    mud.&nbsp; This can create issues for back-ups, meaning that not only 
do   you  have to back-up your database (or your data directory)&nbsp; but 
you   have to  backup all those files that have been modified and added, since
 they play as  integral a role in your world as the rooms and areas do.&nbsp;
 All those files  can also create upgrade issues, as modified files can get
 accidently overwritten  when a new version of CoffeeMud is overlayed in
your  installation  directory.&nbsp; Lastly, this can create security issues,
as  the builders might  accidently delete the wrong file, or make a mistake,
creating problems for the  admins as they try to recover.</p>
               
<p>To help solve these problems, the CoffeeMud engine uses a kind of mirrored 
    file system called <strong>CMFS</strong> to store some files in your local
    directory (your hard drive), some files in your database, and some files
   in both  at the same time.&nbsp; When the exact same file in the exact
same   directory is  found in BOTH the local file system and in the database,
the   one in the database  is always preferred.&nbsp; That way, should the
file   in the database (called a  <strong>VFS</strong>&nbsp;file) become
corrupted   or deleted, the one in the  local file system will remain safe.&nbsp;
Furthermore,   since&nbsp;files in the  database (VFS files) are always accessed
before  the same file in the local file  system, you can overwrite the files
in the  local file system with upgrades  without worrying about losing your
changed  files.&nbsp; And lastly, CoffeeMud  provides a security system that
allows  you to grant access to users on a folder  level, and also to specify
whether  the user can access the local file system, or  only the database
VFS files  and folders.</p>
               
<p>The CMFS includes everything in your CoffeeMud installation directory/folder, 
    and all the other folders therein.&nbsp; In fact, CoffeeMud is utterly 
 unable  to  access any files OUTSIDE of your CoffeeMud installation folder, 
 giving  the  server administrator an added level of comfort.&nbsp; The CMFS 
 is also  able to  access the VFS files in the CoffeeMud database, and to 
give them  preference over  identically named files in your local file system.</p>
               
<p>CMFS employs the UN*X standard for separating directorys and folders.&nbsp; 
    This means that the forward slash / character is used when separating 
one   folder  from another when naming a file.&nbsp; The CMFS path  <strong>/resources/text/intro.txt</strong> 
   would, for example, refer to the file  called intro.txt inside the text 
 directory,  which is inside the resources  directory, which is in your CoffeeMud 
 installation  folder.</p>
               
<p>If that file had been previously copied into the same directory in the 
   VFS  database, then the CMFS would prefer that version over the one that 
  remains in  the local file system.&nbsp; You may modify the file  <strong>resources/text/intro.txt, 
   </strong>update it, and save it without  needing to remember that you are
   really changing a file in the database.&nbsp;  CoffeeMud will always remember
   to prefer to the one in the VFS to the one on  your local hard drive,
if   it has been copied or saved there.&nbsp; </p>
               
<p>If for some reason you absolutely need to ensure that ONLY&nbsp;the local 
    file system version of a file or ONLY the VFS version of a file is referenced 
   by  CoffeeMud, you may do so by prepending a special string to your file 
   paths.&nbsp; The string is double-colon :: to force access of a VFS file, 
   and  double-forward-slash // to force access of a local file system file.&nbsp; 
   For  instance, if the Scriptable prog resources/progs/myprog.script is 
located   in  both your local and VFS file systems, then you can force Scriptable 
 to  use the  VFS version by&nbsp;using &nbsp;<strong>::resources/progs/myprog.script 
    </strong>as your path name.&nbsp; If you needed to force Scriptable to 
 load  the  local file system version of the file <strong>//resources/progs/myprog.script 
    </strong>would do the trick.&nbsp; Again, <strong>resources/progs/myprog.script 
    </strong>alone, without any special prepended file, will prefer the VFS 
  file,  but will use the local file if a VFS file is unavailable.&nbsp; This
  is the  preferred behavior, so your Scriptable filenames should employ the
  normal path  naming standard except under very extraordinary circumstances.</p>
               
<p>Files can be copied into the VFS from the local file system using the Archon
 SHELL command.&nbsp; If you were to go into the coffeemud resources folder
using  this command:</p>
               
<p><strong><font face="Courier New">shell cd /resources</font></strong></p>
               
<p>if you now view the directory</p>
               
<p><strong><font face="Courier New">shell dir</font></strong></p>
               
<p>you'll see all the files in your local filesystem in the resources folder 
   in  your coffeemud installation directory.&nbsp; Now, you may copy all 
of   the files  in this directory into the *same* directory in the VFS database 
   by entering:</p>
               
<p><strong><font face="Courier New">shell copy *  ::/resources</font></strong></p>
               
<p>the copy command here is followed by a wild-card character,  the&nbsp;asterisk, 
   to designate ALL files in the resources directory.&nbsp; The  next parameter 
   is the destination folder.&nbsp; In this case, we specify our  destination 
   as ::/resources, which would be the same directory, but in the VFS  system.&nbsp; 
   Notice that we did not have to create a VFS folder called  /resources before
   we did this.&nbsp; The VFS always has a mirror copy of all the  local
file    system folders.&nbsp; However, it requires you to use the SHELL COPY
 command    to create a mirror of the files themselves.&nbsp; Now, look at
the  directory    again:</p>
               
<p><strong><font face="Courier New">shell dir /resources</font></strong></p>
               
<p>We displayed the directory this time using an absolute path name, just 
   to  show you the syntax.&nbsp; You are still looking at the same directory 
   you saw  when you entered <strong><font face="Courier New">shell dir</font></strong>. 
   In  fact, you can enter that command again to prove it.&nbsp; You'll see 
  that all of  the files have little "+" marks next to them.&nbsp; This means 
  that the files  exist both in your local file system *AND* in the VFS.&nbsp; 
  Now suppose we did  something silly, like delete our local file system version
   of  resources/socials.txt. This could be done with the following command:</p>
               
<p><strong><font face="Courier New">shell delete  //resources/socials.txt</font></strong></p>
               
<p>Notice that we used the double-slash // to designate that we want to delete 
    the LOCAL version.&nbsp; Had we not put those two slashes in front, it 
 would   have preferred the VFS copy of socials.txt and deleted that one instead.&nbsp;
    Now, look at the directory again:</p>
               
<p><strong><font face="Courier New">shell dir *</font></strong></p>
               
<p>This time we displayed the directory using an * wildcard, just to demonstrate 
    that we can use mask characters when displaying directories.&nbsp; The 
 command   is doing the same thing the previous two <strong><font
 face="Courier New">shell  dir</font></strong> commands did, just in a different 
   way.&nbsp; Now, you'll see  that most of the files still have the "+" sign
   in front, but  now&nbsp;<strong>socials.txt</strong> only has a "-" character.&nbsp;
    This&nbsp;means that the file exists only in the&nbsp;VFS database, and
  not on  our local hard drive.&nbsp; We can copy it back to our local file
  system by  doing:&nbsp;</p>
               
<p><strong><font face="Courier New">shell copy&nbsp;::socials.txt  //</font></strong></p>
               
<p>You'll see that I changed the syntax of the copy command around again to
 demonstrate some of the previous lessons.&nbsp; We use the :: characters 
   in  front of the filename socials.txt to specify that we want to copy the
   VFS  version of the file.&nbsp; Since the VFS version is always preferred 
   and  accessed first, the copy command would have worked just fine without 
   the two ::  characters in front.&nbsp; The last parameter is just two slash
   marks.&nbsp;  When no directory or folder is specified, the default and
 current  directory is  used.&nbsp; In this case, we only specified the two
 slash marks  to denote the  local file system, and we did not specify a
destination   folder.&nbsp;  This means  that the file socials.txt will be
copied into  the current folder,  on the local  file system only.</p>
               
<p>There are numerous other shell commands you can make use of, such as 
<strong><font face="Courier New">makedirectory</font></strong> to create
new  folders, <strong><font face="Courier New">edit</font></strong> to modify
a text  file, <strong><font face="Courier New">findfile</font></strong> to
hunt down a  file with a given name, or <strong><font face="Courier New">searchtext</font></strong> 
   to find a file containing a given  text string. The shell command is a 
useful   tool for mirror your local files in  your VFS database for safety, 
convenience,   and easy back-ups.</p>
               
<p>The last topic concerning the CMFS is about security.&nbsp; At the top 
   of  this Guide, the subject of security codes was discussed.&nbsp; Well, 
  CMFS  provides its own security codes to limit access to files and folders 
  in either  the local file system, the VFS, or both.&nbsp; </p>
               
<p>By default, a user is not allowed to access any files in either file system, 
    unless they are an Archon or have been given a CMFS security code.&nbsp; 
   The two  security codes are <strong>FS: [ABSOLUTE_PATH]</strong> and <strong>VFS: 
    [ABSOLUTE_PATH].&nbsp; </strong>In cmfs security codes, the [absolute 
path]   is a  path name starting from inside your coffeemud directory, with 
no path-separating    slashes&nbsp; except to separate directories or to designate&nbsp;that
the  last  file is really&nbsp;a&nbsp;directory by using a trailing forward
 slash.&nbsp;&nbsp;  </p>
               
<p>For example, to give a user access ONLY to files in the VFS database folder 
    /resources/text/, you would give the user security code <strong>VFS: 
RESOURCES/TEXT/   </strong>The user would then have permission to view or 
delete  any of the   VFS database versions of files that have been copied 
into that  directory   from the local file system.&nbsp; The user would also 
have permission  to   create new files or create new directories in the VFS 
inside that  folder.&nbsp;   Directories and files created by such a user, 
who only has a VFS  security   code, would not create ANY files in your local 
file system.&nbsp; All  files   would reside only in the VFS database.&nbsp; 
This user would not even be   able to copy existing local file system files 
into the VFS to modify, since   he  does not have access.&nbsp; </p>
               
<p>To give the same user access to BOTH the local file system and VFS versions 
    of the resources/text directory, the security code would need to changed 
   to  <strong>FS: RESOURCES/TEXT/&nbsp; </strong>Using FS instead of VFS 
gives   the  user access to both local and database versions of those files.&nbsp; 
   </p>
               
<p>Of course, by default, an Archon has access to both versions of the entire 
    coffeemud installation folder.&nbsp; It would be as if the Archon had 
the    security code <strong>FS:</strong> With no directory specified, the 
Archon   has  local file system (and implied VFS)&nbsp; access to the root 
directory   and  everything underneath it.&nbsp; For that reason, when limiting 
access   to the  file system, it is best to use the VFS: security code, and 
to always   designate a  limited directory path in which your adminitrative 
user may  play (upload their  files, save their scripts, etc).</p>
