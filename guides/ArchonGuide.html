<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center><STRONG>By Archon Grothus Gallslanger 
of the&nbsp;Free City of Maltan</STRONG></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Causing buildings and towers to appear along paved streets, mountains to rise 
from the dust, and then breathing life into this worlds denizens may seem like a 
daunting task, but you will quickly discover that it is not so.&nbsp; All it 
takes is some careful planning, and educated execution.</P>
<P><STRONG>Planning is the First Step</STRONG></P>
<P>Before a single bird can flitter through the skies that you opened up, you 
must have planned the placement of that sky, and the song of that bird.&nbsp; I 
am assuming you have been given some general area to construct, some wicked 
kingdom, joyous elven city by the sea, or some other such nonsense.&nbsp; If 
not, get one; decide on the general theme of some area you wish to 
construct.</P>
<P>At this point I suggest you&nbsp;get a piece of graph paper or 
parchment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon it you shall draw small squares next to each 
other.&nbsp; Plot out every location you will create.&nbsp; The squares need not 
be equal in size, but they need to all fit together somehow.&nbsp; Before 
invoking the spells of creation, you should know where every door leads, where 
every path ends, and if X indeed marks the spot, where the X is.<BR><BR>Inside 
each square, you shall make small notes.&nbsp; What notes?&nbsp; Well, that's 
the next part of our story.</P>
<P><STRONG>Understanding Rooms</STRONG></P>
<P>At the foundation of the CoffeeMud world is the room.&nbsp; Now, a room is 
not just some pink wallpapered play area, but simply a place.&nbsp; Certainly a 
kitchen can be a room, as can a pink wallpapered play area, but so can the 
bottom of a well, a stretch of rolling hills, the top of a tall mountain, or a 
dragon’s lair deep underground.&nbsp; Physical size does not matter with rooms; 
only your imagination can determine that.</P>
<P>Every room has a general foundational type that defines it.&nbsp; That type 
determines the behavior of that room day to day, whether it is outside or 
inside, made of wood or stone, a mountain or a plain, in darkness or light, a 
cliffside or deep in the ocean.&nbsp; This foundational type of every room has a 
name: Locale.&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you log into CoffeeMud right now, you can list the available Locales with 
the command "list locales".&nbsp; This list should include many different types 
of locales, most of which are self-explanatory.&nbsp; They include:</P>
<P>CaveMaze -- a dark, dank, multi-room maze of 
caves<BR>CaveRoom -- dark and dank<BR>CaveSurface -- dark and dank 
ClimbableSurface<BR>CityStreet -- 
outside urban area<BR>ClimbableSurface -- an area that can only be climbed or flown

ceiling<BR>StoneRoom -- well lit indoor room with stone walls and 
ceiling<BR>TreeSurface -- a wooden ClimbableSurface, such as the trunk of a 
tree<BR>UnderWater -- as wet as it gets... 
unless you are a fish you won't live long<BR>UnderWaterGrid -- a huge multi-room 
underwater locale<BR>UnderWaterMaze -- a huge multi-room maze of underwater 
locales -- be careful!<BR>WetCaveMaze -- as CaveMaze, but extremely wet and 
nasty<BR>WetCaveRoom -- a wet and nasty CaveRoom<BR>WoodRoom -- well lit indoor room 
with wooden walls and ceiling<BR>Woods -- thick with trees and life, the bright 
forest<BR>WoodsGrid -- thick with trees and life, multi-room 
expanse<BR>WoodsMaze -- thick with trees and life, a multi-room maze of 
woodlands<BR><BR>For each room you are drawing on your graph 
parchment, you should note in the Locale type of the room from the above list, or from the list you received when you entered "list locales" 
into CoffeeMud.</P>
<P>The detailed properties of rooms are discussed further in the section on 
creating rooms.</P>
<P><STRONG>Understanding Exits</STRONG></P>
<P>Now surely you did not expect everyone to conjure him or herself from place 
to place!&nbsp; Why, the pitiful halfling thieves would starve in their holes if 
this were so.&nbsp; No, each of the rooms you have drawn on your paper will be 
connected with things called Exits.</P>
<P>For any two rooms that one can travel between, there are always two 
exits.&nbsp; One exit leads from the first room to the second. Another exit 
leads from the second room to the first.&nbsp; Usually those exits are the same, 
but they need not be if you don't want them to be so.</P>
<P>  All exits will take a person from one room to another, and may even 
take them back again if you choose.&nbsp; An exit can only be located in one 
of six directions: North, South, East, West, Up, and Down.&nbsp; The 
four compass directions are easy to fathom, but be careful with up and down, as they 
need not be unhindered flight, or a reckless fall.&nbsp; If, for 
instance, the destination room is a Locale like "InTheAir", then Up obviously 
represents the open sky.&nbsp; If it is another "StoneRoom", however, it probably 
represents a flight of stairs.&nbsp; The Down direction may represent falling off 
a cliff, but it may also represent a ladder down to the basement.&nbsp; 
Either way is fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Exits, like rooms, can be of many different types.&nbsp; If you are still in 
CoffeeMud, enter the command "list exits".&nbsp; The list you receive describes 
the many connectors that can be mixed and matched between rooms.&nbsp; Some 
include doors, and some include doors with locks.&nbsp; There are walkways with 
pits, doors with needle traps, and many others.&nbsp; By far the most common of 
these Exits is called "Open".&nbsp; It describes a completely free and clear 
path between the two rooms you are creating.</P>
<P>As you finish your graph parchment drawing, be sure to note those places 
where there are doors, locked doors, pit traps, and open walkways.&nbsp; If a 
door is one way, or if a door leads to one place when one enters, but does not 
go back to there when one leaves, make a note of that too.</P>
<P>                
 However, it may come to pass that there is a rickety straw door to 
some hut you wish to have, but it was not 
listed among your choices.&nbsp; Fear not, for there is "GenExit".&nbsp; "GenExit" 
stands for "Generic Exit", and represents the finest in Archon power.&nbsp; 
A completely customizable exit flowing from one room to another.&nbsp; GenExits, as well as the 
other features of exits, are discussed further in the section on creating exits.</P>
<P><BR><STRONG>Understanding That Which Creepeth Upon the Land</STRONG></P>
<P>The denizens of your land are surely the greatest accomplishment you will 
claim.&nbsp; From the lowly cooks in your kitchens to the great beasts in the 
darkest dungeons, it is they who will be remembered by those who visit your 
realm.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Funny then that for things so important, they should have such a short, ugly 
sounding name: MOB.&nbsp; If you are in CoffeeMud, you can list them: "list 
mobs".&nbsp; It will show you every creature that can populate your cities, 
dwell in your dungeons, or hide in your pantries.&nbsp; </P>
<P>If a creature is not listed there that you require, there 
is always the GenMob, that nasty formless being that can be shaped by the Archon to 
appear and behave exactly as it should.&nbsp; A GenShopkeeper is also available to provide valuable 
services for your community.&nbsp; For more devious spirits, however, the GenUndead is 
also available, to strike fear in the hearts of the purest cleric.</P>
<P>GenMobs, as well as the features of MOBs, are discussed further in the 
section on creating MOBs.</P>
<P><STRONG>The Things We Treasure</STRONG></P>
<P>Our last planning topic is that of the items that will be found in your 
land.&nbsp; Some of them will be priceless once-in-a-lifetime creations.&nbsp; 
Others will be reoccurring trapped chests that always seem to have enough gold 
for those bold enough to continuously risk their guardians.</P>
<P>The items can be discovered using the "list items" command.&nbsp; Other items 
include weapons, which can be discovered through "list weapons", armor from 
"list armor", and other miscellaneous enchanted items through "list 
magic".&nbsp; </P>
<P>For those items you need by are not present, there is also the "GenItem",&nbsp;"GenBoat", "GenCoins", "GenCorpse", "GenKey", "GenLantern", 
"GenLightSource", "GenMap",&nbsp;&nbsp;"GenContainer", "GenFood", "GenWater", and "GenReadable".&nbsp; For the 
fighting spirit there is 
the "GenWeapon", "GenStaff", and "GenArmor".&nbsp; Among the&nbsp;formless magical items are 
"GenPill", "GenPotion", "GenScroll", "GenWand", and "GenSuperPill".&nbsp; 
These and the many properties of items are discussed below under the section on 
creating items.</P>
<P><STRONG>The Art of Creation</STRONG></P>
<P>Before beginning, you should log into CoffeeMud and take yourself to some 
place that is adjacent to the area you will be forming.&nbsp; You should also 
cast the spell of natural enlightenment using the following command: 
"sysmsgs".&nbsp; You should see an utterance that reads "Extended messages are 
now: ON".&nbsp; </P>
<P>Now your eyes will behold new wonders when you look around the rooms:&nbsp; 
You will see the Locale types of the room, the Room IDs that have been assigned 
uniquely to each room, the Area IDs of the area you are in.&nbsp; They should 
look like this:</P>
<P>Area&nbsp; :(MyArea)<BR>Locale: (StoneRoom)&nbsp; <BR>(MyArea#123) Joe Bob's Room</P>
<P>The first line lists the area name, the second line the 
locale type we talked about earlier, and the&nbsp;third line lists the Room ID, 
followed by the Room Name.&nbsp; Take note of them all, my friend, and learn to 
appreciate their beauty.&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG>Creating Rooms</STRONG></P>
<P>Now that you have your plan laid out, it is quite time to being 
execution.&nbsp; Gather your strength, and begin harnessing the power of the 
Archon, for you will need every ounce of it when the wood and rock chips start 
flying.</P>
<P>To create a new room most easily, you must first be standing in&nbsp;a room 
adjacent to it,&nbsp;one that will be connected to it through some exit.&nbsp; 
You will then utter the invocation of room creation, summoning the Locale in the 
direction that the new room should be.&nbsp; For instance, you wish to have a 
new room&nbsp;north of room "MyArea#123".&nbsp; If room&nbsp;"MyArea#123” is 
already created, and the new room&nbsp;is going to be of the "StoneRoom" Locale, 
you would bring yourself to room&nbsp;"MyArea#123" and utter the words:&nbsp; 
"create stoneroom north".</P>
<P><IMG alt="" 
src="createroom.gif"></P>
<P>At this point, you should cover your ears, as the sound of a stone room 
falling to the north is often quite disturbing.&nbsp; Between the two rooms; the 
one you are standing in, and the one you have created, will be a default exit: 
the Open exit.&nbsp; Most times, that is ok, though changing it will be the 
subject of the next section.</P>
<P>However, once this is done, and the rooms are irrevocably linked, you can 
still throw a small twist on things.&nbsp; If you are still standing in room 
"MyArea#123" and wish to create a NEW StoneRoom in the SAME direction, it can be 
done.&nbsp; Uttering the words "create StoneRoom north" AGAIN and a new room is 
created.&nbsp; Now, what happened with "MyArea#124" you’re wondering?&nbsp; It 
is still there, and it still leads back to where you are standing -- a one way 
exit.</P>
<P><IMG alt="" 
src="createroom2.gif"></P>
<P><STRONG>Modifying Rooms</STRONG></P>
<P> For now, once you have created the new room, it is time to design 
the landscape of it.&nbsp; To do this, you should enter the room through the 
default Open exit that was created for you.&nbsp; You will find the room plain 
and boring.&nbsp; </P>
<P>To give the room a new name and description, utter the 
invocation: "modify room" and follow the promptings.&nbsp; You will also be 
asked to add any "behaviors" and "affects" to the room that you wish to.&nbsp; 
These may seem strange at first, and usually you won't add any of these at 
all.&nbsp; After all, rarely does a plot of dirt exibit any behavior, and what 
the heck is an affect?&nbsp; Well! To the first, the wind blowing through the 
trees, the hoot of an owl, or a distant cackling noise are all considerable 
behaviors.&nbsp; In fact, it is a behavior called "Emoter".&nbsp; Enter "help 
behaviors" for more information about the Emoter behavior.&nbsp; As for affects, 
well, affects are special properties which you can attach to your new little 
hole in the ground.&nbsp; There are lots of nice properties that one may add to 
a Room, such as "Prop_ReqNoMOB" to make your room a player-only place to 
be.&nbsp; There is also "Prop_MagicFreedom" to fluster any spell-using folks 
that happen along, or "Prop_NoChannel" for a place of quiet... you'll need 
"Prop_PeaceMaker" to go with it if you want peace AND quiet.&nbsp; To learn more 
about the properties you can add to rooms, enter "help properties" while you are in CoffeeMud.&nbsp; Now, isn't this fun?&nbsp; 
Remember, if you make a mistake, fear not, for the land does not grow weary 
of your molding.&nbsp; </P>
<P>* IMPORTANT * If this room is the first room in the new area you are 
embarking upon, you should change its Area ID to that of the new one.&nbsp; 
Create NO FURTHER ROOMS until this is done, and ensure that all future rooms in 
the area are created out of this new one.&nbsp; To change the Area that a room 
belongs to, enter the command: "modify room area newareaname".&nbsp; Where I 
have entered "newareaname", you should enter the name of the area you are 
creating.&nbsp; Now, any future rooms that you build by standing in this room 
will bear its area mark, as well as any rooms created from any room bearing your 
new area mark.&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG>Linking Two Rooms Together</STRONG></P>
<P>If you have created an area, and wish to link one of the rooms in your area 
with one of another, you can use a command that utilizes the Room IDs mentioned 
above.&nbsp; If you would like to create a northerly link from room "MyArea#123" 
to a room whose room ID is "MyArea#124", then you need only stand in room 
"MyArea#123", and utter the invocation:&nbsp; "link MyArea#124 north".&nbsp; 
This will create an Open exit between the room you are standing in, and the room 
whose ID is born out.&nbsp; </P>
<P><IMG alt="" 
src="linkroom.gif"></P>
<P>You should note that this command could be used as it was in the last section 
to create one-way exits to existing rooms.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>Unlinking Two Rooms</STRONG></P>
<P>If you wish to detach two rooms from each other, you need only learn the 
wicked "destroy command".&nbsp; If you are standing in the room to the south of 
the one you wish to unlink, and the room you wish to detach from is to the 
north, utter the command: "unlink north".&nbsp; It will do the trick!</P>
<P><IMG alt="" 
src="destroyroom.gif"></P>
<P>Keep in mind that just because there is no longer a route from the room you 
are in to the other via a northerly path, it does not mean that there is no path 
from the detached room back to here again.&nbsp; You may have to conjure 
yourself into the&nbsp;other place and enter a "destroy south" command to 
completely detach them forever.</P>
<P><STRONG>Destroying a Room</STRONG></P>
<P>        Sometimes the pain born from a failed or 
evil place is too much to bear, and as an Archon, you can 
do something about it.&nbsp; This involves the destroy command.&nbsp; It does not merely unlink 
the room, but obliterates it altogether and forever.&nbsp; To do this, first 
make sure you are not standing in the room you wish to destroy.&nbsp; Such 
destructive magic would surely be your end as well.&nbsp; Then you must utilize 
the Room ID of the doomed place.&nbsp; If the room you wish to destroy has the 
Room ID of "MyArea#124", then enter:&nbsp; "destroy MyArea#124".&nbsp; It will 
obliterate that place from the planet forever.</P>
<P><IMG alt="" 
src="destroyroom2.gif"></P>
<P><STRONG>Creating Exits</STRONG></P>
<P>The difference between Exits and Rooms is a very important one.&nbsp; 
Creating and destroying Rooms describes <EM>WHETHER</EM> two rooms are 
connected, and by which direction.&nbsp; Creating and destroying Exits describes 
<EM>HOW</EM> one gets from one room to the next.&nbsp; Two rooms must be 
connected together before exits between them can be modified.</P>
<P>For instance, suppose you linked "MyArea#123" and "MyArea#124" as described 
above.&nbsp; By default, you get an StdOpenDoorway, also known as an "Open" 
exit.&nbsp; These exits can be walked through freely.&nbsp; Now suppose you wish 
to have a Door between the two rooms.&nbsp; If the exits between the two rooms 
are both the same, and you are standing in the southernmost room of the two, 
then changing them both is simply a matter of issuing the command "create Door 
north".</P>
<P><IMG alt="" 
src="createexit.gif"></P>
<P><STRONG>Destroying Exits</STRONG></P>
<P>Just as unlinking rooms disconnects them, destroying exits can SEEM to disconnect 
them.&nbsp; When you issue a simple destroy command, and refer specifically to 
the exit, then you will not be destroying the link between the two rooms, but 
merely the exit that travels between them.&nbsp; Archons can still travel 
through these missing links, but players will not be able to.&nbsp; Also, 
destroying an exit only deletes the exit in one direction, not both.&nbsp; For 
instance, if you are standing in the southerly room of two linked rooms that 
both have Exits between them, and you issue the command "destroy exit north", 
you will destroy the Open exit between the rooms.&nbsp; As an Archon, you can 
still travel north through the destroyed exit, but players will not be able 
to.</P>
<P><IMG alt="" 
src="destroyexit.gif"></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Now, that an exit has been deleted, it is possible to create a DIFFERENT kind 
of exit for the northerly direction from MyArea#123 to MyArea#124.&nbsp; Issuing 
a create command like "create Door north" will create a door that leads from 
MyArea#123 to MyArea#124, WITHOUT AFFECTING the Open path from MyArea#124 to 
MyArea#123.&nbsp; This is only possible when the exits between two rooms are 
different, or one is deleted, as is our case here.</P>
<P><IMG alt="" 
src="destroyexit3.gif"></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Now, suppose you wanted to have the same Door going between two rooms.&nbsp; 
For sure this is a more common scenario than the example we just went 
through.&nbsp; To do this, you must first delete BOTH of the exits between two 
rooms as described above. That means entering MyArea#123 and entering "destroy 
exit north", and then entering MyArea#124 and entering "destroy exit 
south".&nbsp; </P>
<P><IMG alt="" 
src="destroyexit2.gif"></P>
<P>Now, with both exits deleted (and thus the same), you can create a single door between them as we did 
in the first part of this section using the "create Door south" command.</P>
<P><IMG alt="" 
src="createexit2.gif"></P>
<P><STRONG>The "GenExit"</STRONG></P>
<P>As mentioned briefly earlier, the GenExit is an undefined exit that one can 
mold to fit ones needs.&nbsp; Whenever a GenExit is created or modified, you 
will be presented with a series of properties to change.&nbsp; Hitting return 
will leave most of these&nbsp;properties without modification.&nbsp; Entering 
new values will replace the old values.&nbsp; These properties include:</P>

properties mentioned above.&nbsp; If the exit is anything other, than you will 
be prompted to enter the Miscellaneous Text field.&nbsp; For a

      way.</TD></TR>
    <TR><TD><EM>Damage/Hit</EM></TD><TD>this represents the maximum amount of damage a 
      MOB does when striking its opponents.&nbsp; At first level, 4-8 is 
      plenty.&nbsp; At 25th level, 10-30 is a good range, depending upon the

    <TR><TD><EM>Armor </EM></TD><TD>the amount of protection the beast has against

      good number.&nbsp; Again, just keep the default.</TD></TR>
    <TR><TD><EM>Hit Points/Level</EM></TD><TD>this is a multiplier used to determine the

      at default.</TD></TR>

      anyone any good.</TD></TR>

<P><STRONG>Modifying MOBs</STRONG>

<P>There are properties of&nbsp;mobs that can be modified by the Archon.&nbsp; If one wishes to modify a 
goblin,&nbsp;the&nbsp;goblin must be&nbsp;present in the room.&nbsp; The Archon can then 
issue the command "modify goblin".&nbsp; If the item is a GenMob or 
GenUndead, then the same properties as above will be presented.&nbsp; See Appendix B for more 
information.&nbsp; For all other MOBs, the following properties will be 
presented:</P>

Dragons, this can have a profound impact.</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><EM>Magical Ability</EM></TD>
    <TD>     
This number represents an adjustment to the 
base properties of the mob.&nbsp; This number, unfortunately, means different things to 
different mob types.&nbsp; For dragons, it may refer to color.&nbsp; For others, it may bring 
a slightly different description.&nbsp; You can play with this value to see if it has 
any effect on the mob you've chosen, though the effects will 
not likely become evident until after the beastie has reloaded.</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><EM>RejuvTicks</EM></TD>
    <TD>             
 This number represents the number of ticks (where a tick is roughly 
4 seconds) before a MOB&nbsp;that has been&nbsp;killed rejuvenates or resets to 
its proper state.&nbsp; The value '2147483647' or '0'&nbsp;means that the&nbsp;MOB never rejuvenates, but once killed, is 
gone forever.&nbsp; Any other value will represent a number of ticks.&nbsp; This 
property does not take effect until the room is saved.&nbsp; For more 
information on making the RejuvTicks property take effect after changing it, see 
below under Rejuvenating Items and Mobs" or "How to Save a

<P><STRONG>Destroying MOBs</STRONG>         </P>
<P>To destroy a MOB&nbsp;that is in the same room as you, you need only issue 
the destroy command.&nbsp;&nbsp;MOBs that have been set to rejuv will not do 
so.&nbsp; If the&nbsp;MOB was a permanently saved&nbsp;MOB in the room, you must 
re-save the room in order to make the MOBs destruction permanent.</P>
<P><STRONG>"Rejuvenating Items and Mobs" or "How to Save a Room"</STRONG></P>
<P>MOBs and Items that are created in rooms, even those which have had the Rejuv 
Ticks property set to some reasonable number, will not actually begin to 
rejuvenate, and will not reappear in the room when CoffeeMud is rebooted, until 
the room is saved.&nbsp; To save a room, you must be standing in it.&nbsp; From 
there, you may issue either the "save items" command to reset the items in the 
room, "save mobs" command to reset the mobs in the room, or "save room" to reset 
them both.&nbsp; You should make sure that the items, mobs, or both, are exactly 
the way you want them to be when the system is rebooted.&nbsp; Players in the 
room, including yourself and your followers, will be ignored by the command to 
save the mobs.</P>
