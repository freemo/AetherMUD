<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center><STRONG>By Archon Grothus Gallslanger 
of the&nbsp;Free City of Maltan</STRONG></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Causing buildings and towers to appear along paved 
streets, mountains to rise from the dust, and then breathing life into this 
worlds denizens may seem like a daunting task, but you will quickly discover 
that it is not so.&nbsp; All it takes is some careful planning, and educated 
execution.</P>
<P><STRONG>Planning is the First 
Step</STRONG></P>
<P>Before a single bird can flitter through the skies that 
you opened up, you must have planned the placement of that sky, and the song of 
that bird.&nbsp; I am assuming you have been given some general area to 
construct, some wicked kingdom, joyous elven city by the sea, or some other such 
nonsense.&nbsp; If not, get one; decide on the general theme of some area you 
wish to construct.</P>
<P>At this point I suggest you&nbsp;get a piece of graph 
paper or parchment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon it you shall draw small squares next 
to each other.&nbsp; Plot out every location you will create.&nbsp; The squares 
need not be equal in size, but they need to all fit together somehow.&nbsp; 
Before invoking the spells of creation, you should know where every door leads, 
where every path ends, and if X indeed marks the spot, where the X is.<BR><BR>Inside each square, you shall make 
small notes.&nbsp; What notes?&nbsp; Well, that's the next part of our 
story.</P>
<P><STRONG>Understanding 
Rooms</STRONG></P>
<P>At the foundation of the CoffeeMud world is the 
room.&nbsp; Now, a room is not just some pink wallpapered play area, but simply 
a place.&nbsp; Certainly a kitchen can be a room, as can a pink wallpapered play 
area, but so can the bottom of a well, a stretch of rolling hills, the top of a 
tall mountain, or a dragon’s lair deep underground.&nbsp; Physical size does not 
matter with rooms; only your imagination can determine that.</P>
<P>Every room has a general foundational type that defines 
it.&nbsp; That type determines the behavior of that room day to day, whether it 
is outside or inside, made of wood or stone, a mountain or a plain, in darkness 
or light, a cliffside or deep in the ocean.&nbsp; This foundational type of 
every room has a name: Locale.&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you log into CoffeeMud right now, you can list the 
available Locales with the command "list locales".&nbsp; This list should 
include many different types of locales, most of which are 
self-explanatory.&nbsp; They include:</P>

<P><BR>For each room you are drawing 
on your graph parchment, you should note in the Locale type of the room from the 
above list, or from the list you received when you entered "list locales" into 
CoffeeMud.</P>
<P>The detailed properties of rooms are discussed further 
in the section on creating rooms.</P>
<P><STRONG>Understanding 
Exits</STRONG></P>
<P>Now surely you did not expect everyone to conjure him or 
herself from place to place!&nbsp; Why, the pitiful halfling thieves would 
starve in their holes if this were so.&nbsp; No, each of the rooms you have 
drawn on your paper will be connected with things called Exits.</P>
<P>For any two rooms that one can travel between, there are 
always two exits.&nbsp; One exit leads from the first room to the second. 
Another exit leads from the second room to the first.&nbsp; Usually those exits 
are the same, but they need not be if you don't want them to be so.</P>
<P>All exits will take a person from one room to another, 
and may even take them back again if you choose.&nbsp; An exit can only be 
located in one of six directions: North, South, East, West, Up, and Down.&nbsp; 
The four compass directions are easy to fathom, but be careful with up and down, 
as they need not be unhindered flight, or a reckless fall.&nbsp; If, for 
instance, the destination room is a Locale like "InTheAir", then Up obviously 
represents the open sky.&nbsp; If it is another "StoneRoom", however, it 
probably represents a flight of stairs.&nbsp; The Down direction may represent 
falling off a cliff, but it may also represent a ladder down to the 
basement.&nbsp; Either way is fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Exits, like rooms, can be of many different types.&nbsp; 
If you are still in CoffeeMud, enter the command "list exits".&nbsp; The list 
you receive describes the many connectors that can be mixed and matched between 
rooms.&nbsp; Some include doors, and some include doors with locks.&nbsp; There 
are walkways with pits, doors with needle traps, and many others.&nbsp; By far 
the most common of these Exits is called "Open".&nbsp; It describes a completely 
free and clear path between the two rooms you are creating.&nbsp; Here is the 
official list:</P>

<P>As you finish your graph parchment drawing, be sure to 
note those places where there are doors, locked doors, pit traps, and open 
walkways.&nbsp; If a door is one way, or if a door leads to one place when one 
enters, but does not go back to there when one leaves, make a note of that 
too.</P>
<P>However, it may come to pass that there is a rickety 
straw door to some hut you wish to have, but it was not listed among your 
choices.&nbsp; Fear not, for there is "GenExit".&nbsp; "GenExit" stands for 
"Generic Exit", and represents the finest in Archon power.&nbsp; A completely 
customizable exit flowing from one room to another.&nbsp; GenExits, as well as 
the other features of exits, are discussed further in the section on creating 
exits.</P>
<P><BR><STRONG>Understanding That Which Creepeth Upon the 
Land</STRONG></P>
<P>The denizens of your land are surely the greatest 
accomplishment you will claim.&nbsp; From the lowly cooks in your kitchens to 
the great beasts in the darkest dungeons, it is they who will be remembered by 
those who visit your realm.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Funny then that for things so important, they should 
have such a short, ugly sounding name: MOB.&nbsp; If you are in CoffeeMud, you 
can list them: "list mobs".&nbsp; It will show you every creature that can 
populate your cities, dwell in your dungeons, or hide in your pantries.&nbsp; 
They are too numerous to list here. </P>
<P>If a creature is not listed there that you require, 
there is always the GenMob, that nasty formless being that can be shaped by the 
Archon to appear and behave exactly as it should.&nbsp; A GenShopkeeper is also 
available to provide valuable services for your community.&nbsp; GenDeitys give 
your Clerics employment. GenRideable mobs provide transport.&nbsp; For more 
devious spirits, however, the GenUndead is also available, to strike fear in the 
hearts of the purest cleric.</P>
<P>GenMobs, as well as the features of MOBs, are discussed 
further in the section on creating MOBs.</P>
<P><STRONG>The Things We 
Treasure</STRONG></P>
<P>Our last planning topic is that of the items that will 
be found in your land.&nbsp; Some of them will be priceless once-in-a-lifetime 
creations.&nbsp; Others will be reoccurring trapped chests that always seem to 
have enough gold for those bold enough to continuously risk their guardians.</P>
<P>The items can be discovered using the "list items" 
command.&nbsp; Other items include weapons, which can be discovered through 
"list weapons", armor from "list armor", and other miscellaneous enchanted items 
through "list magic".&nbsp; </P>
<P>For those items you need by are not present, there is 
also the "GenItem",&nbsp;"GenBoat", "GenChair", "GenBed", "GenCoins", 
"GenCorpse", "GenKey", "GenLantern", "GenLightSource", 
"GenMap",&nbsp;&nbsp;"GenRideable", "GenWallpaper", "GenJournal", 
"GenContainer", "GenFood", "GenWater", and "GenReadable".&nbsp; For the fighting 
spirit there is the "GenWeapon", "GenStaff", and "GenArmor".&nbsp; Among 
the&nbsp;formless magical items are "GenPill", "GenPotion", "GenScroll", 
"GenWand", and "GenSuperPill".&nbsp; These and the many properties of items are 
discussed below under the section on creating items.</P>
<P><STRONG>The Art of 
Creation</STRONG></P>
<P>Before beginning, you should log into CoffeeMud and take 
yourself to some place that is adjacent to the area you will be forming.&nbsp; 
You should also cast the spell of natural enlightenment using the following 
command: "sysmsgs".&nbsp; You should see an utterance that reads "Extended 
messages are now: ON".&nbsp; </P>
<P>Now your eyes will behold new wonders when you look 
around the rooms:&nbsp; You will see the Locale types of the room, the Room IDs 
that have been assigned uniquely to each room, the Area IDs of the area you are 
in.&nbsp; They should look like this:</P>
<P>Area&nbsp; :(MyArea)<BR>Locale: 
(StoneRoom)&nbsp; <BR>(MyArea#123) Joe Bob's Room</P>
<P>The first line lists the area name, the second line the 
locale type we talked about earlier, and the&nbsp;third line lists the Room ID, 
followed by the Room Name.&nbsp; Take note of them all, my friend, and learn to 
appreciate their beauty.&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG>Creating Rooms</STRONG></P>
<P>Now that you have your plan laid out, it is quite time 
to being execution.&nbsp; Gather your strength, and begin harnessing the power 
of the Archon, for you will need every ounce of it when the wood and rock chips 
start flying.</P>
<P>To create a new room most easily, you must first be 
standing in&nbsp;a room adjacent to it,&nbsp;one that will be connected to it 
through some exit.&nbsp; You will then utter the invocation of room creation, 
summoning the Locale in the direction that the new room should be.&nbsp; For 
instance, you wish to have a new room&nbsp;north of room "MyArea#123".&nbsp; If 
room&nbsp;"MyArea#123” is already created, and the new room&nbsp;is going to be 
of the "StoneRoom" Locale, you would bring yourself to room&nbsp;"MyArea#123" 
and utter the words:&nbsp; "create stoneroom north".</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/createroom.gif" ></P>
<P>At this point, you should cover your ears, as the sound 
of a stone room falling to the north is often quite disturbing.&nbsp; Between 
the two rooms; the one you are standing in, and the one you have created, will 
be a default exit: the Open exit.&nbsp; Most times, that is ok, though changing 
it will be the subject of the next section.</P>
<P>However, once this is done, and the rooms are 
irrevocably linked, you can still throw a small twist on things.&nbsp; If you 
are still standing in room "MyArea#123" and wish to create a NEW StoneRoom in 
the SAME direction, it can be done.&nbsp; Uttering the words "create StoneRoom 
north" AGAIN and a new room is created.&nbsp; Now, what happened with 
"MyArea#124" you’re wondering?&nbsp; It is still there, and it still leads back 
to where you are standing -- a one way exit.</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/createroom2.gif" ></P>
<P><STRONG>Creating and Modifying 
Areas </STRONG></P>
<P>A town or village, country or demesnes can hardly come 
to be without the careful demarcation of their borders.&nbsp; What seperates the 
town from the country, or one country from another?&nbsp; Like everything else, 
this is the decision of the Archon as he groups his rooms into Areas.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The best way to create your areas is to do so right from 
the start.&nbsp; The moment you create the first plot of land in your new area, 
or lay down the first building in your new town, you should designate it as 
such.&nbsp; Enter the new room in your new area and utter the mystic chant 
"modify room area New Area Name".&nbsp; Of course, where "New Area Name" can be 
anything you wish.&nbsp; Call it "Newarea Land" or "Goldfish Villiage" or "The 
Fruity Phantasm" or whatever strikes your fancy.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Now that you have designated your new room as belonging 
to a new area, it is important to remember to create all future rooms 
by&nbsp;doing so from&nbsp;rooms that already belong to the new area.&nbsp; Any 
future rooms that you build by standing in your new area room will bear its area 
mark, as well as any rooms created from any other room bearing the new area 
mark.&nbsp; If you fail then, you may be forced to invoke the power of the 
"modify room area..." command again to re-group the rooms you are creating.<BR><BR>Areas also contain important 
properties which may be modified.&nbsp; Enter the secret code "modify area" to 
go through a list of these modifiable properties.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The <EM>name</EM> and <EM>description</EM> of the area may be changed by 
following the promptings.&nbsp; You may also tinker with the <EM>climate</EM> of 
your area, which will affect the types of weather that will blow through it, and 
how mild or severe the winters and summers may be.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also where 
you may add <EM>SubOps</EM>.&nbsp; A SubOp is a player who has (almost) 
Archon-like powers within areas you designate.&nbsp; Designate SubOps if 
creating a universe becomes a little bit too much work for one person.</P>
<P>Strange settings like <EM>Technology Level</EM> and <EM>Archive File 
Name</EM> are available on the area promptings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't worry about 
these.&nbsp; The former is not very important at the moment, and the second is a 
bit too obscure for these lessons.</P>
<P>You will also be asked to add any <EM>behaviors </EM>and <EM>affects</EM> to 
the&nbsp;area that you wish to.&nbsp; These may seem strange at first, and 
usually you won't add any of these at all.&nbsp; After all, rarely does a plot 
of dirt exibit any behavior, and what the heck is an affect?&nbsp; Well! To the 
first, the wind blowing through the trees, the hoot of an owl, or a distant 
cackling noise are all considerable behaviors.&nbsp; In fact, it is a behavior 
called "Emoter".&nbsp; Enter "ahelp emoter" for more information about the 
Emoter behavior.&nbsp; As for affects, well, affects are special properties 
which you can attach to your new little holes in the ground.&nbsp; There are 
lots of nice properties that one may add to an&nbsp;Area, which will affect 
every room in it, such as "Prop_ReqNoMOB" to make your area a player-only place 
to be.&nbsp; There is also "Prop_MagicFreedom" to fluster any spell-using folks 
that happen along, or "Prop_NoChannel" for a place of quiet... you'll need 
"Prop_PeaceMaker" to go with it if you want peace AND quiet.&nbsp; To learn more 
about the properties you can add to areas and rooms, enter "ahelp" while you are 
in CoffeeMud.&nbsp; Now, isn't this fun?&nbsp; Remember, if you make a mistake, 
fear not, for the land does not grow weary of your molding.&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG>Modifying 
Rooms</STRONG></P>
<P>For now, once you have created a new room, it is time to 
design the landscape of it.&nbsp; To do this, you should enter the room through 
the default Open exit that was created for you.&nbsp; You will find the room 
plain and boring.&nbsp; </P>
<P>To give the room a new name and description, utter the 
invocation: "modify room" and follow the promptings.&nbsp; Like the area above, 
rooms may have behaviors and affects added to them.&nbsp; In this case, the 
behaviors and affects will only be active for this particular room. </P>
<P>If you are ever wandering around, and wish to go 
directly to a room you have created, you may utter the magic matra "goto 
RoomID".&nbsp; For instance, entering "goto MyArea#123" would take you to the 
room we created above.&nbsp; This will especially come in handy when we begin to 
create and destroy the links between rooms, and there is no other way to get to 
a room.</P>
<P><STRONG>Linking Two Rooms 
Together</STRONG></P>
<P>Now that&nbsp;you have created a room, and wish to link 
one of the rooms in your area with one of another, you can use a command that 
utilizes the Room IDs mentioned above.&nbsp; If you would like to create a 
northerly link from room "MyArea#123" to a room whose room ID is "MyArea#124", 
then you need only stand in room "MyArea#123" (use the "goto" command if you 
must), and utter the invocation:&nbsp; "link MyArea#124 north".&nbsp; This will 
create an Open exit between the room you are standing in, and the room whose ID 
is born out.&nbsp; </P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/linkroom.gif" ></P>
<P>You should note that this command could be used as it 
was in the last section to create one-way exits to existing rooms.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>Unlinking Two 
Rooms</STRONG></P>
<P>If you wish to detach two rooms from each other, you 
need only learn the "unlink" command.&nbsp; If you are standing in the room to 
the south of the one you wish to unlink, and the room you wish to detach from is 
to the north, utter the command: "unlink north".&nbsp; It will do the trick!</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/destroyroom.gif" ></P>
<P>Keep in mind that just because there is no longer a 
route from the room you are in to the other via a northerly path, it does not 
mean that there is no path from the detached room back to here again.&nbsp; You 
may have to conjure yourself into the&nbsp;other place and enter a "unlink 
south" command to completely detach them forever.</P>
<P><STRONG>Destroying a 
Room</STRONG></P>
<P>Sometimes the pain born from a failed or evil place is 
too much to bear, and as an Archon, you can do something about it.&nbsp; This 
involves the destroy command.&nbsp; It does not merely unlink the room, but 
obliterates it altogether and forever.&nbsp; To do this, first make sure you are 
not standing in the room you wish to destroy.&nbsp; Such destructive magic would 
surely be your end as well.&nbsp; Then you must utilize the Room ID of the 
doomed place.&nbsp; If the room you wish to destroy has the Room ID of 
"MyArea#124", then enter:&nbsp; "destroy MyArea#124".&nbsp; It will obliterate 
that place from the planet forever.</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/destroyroom2.gif" ></P>
<P><STRONG>Creating Exits</STRONG></P>
<P>The difference between Exits and Rooms is a very 
important one.&nbsp; Creating and destroying Rooms describes <EM>WHETHER</EM> two rooms are connected, and by which 
direction.&nbsp; Creating and destroying Exits describes <EM>HOW</EM> one gets from one room to the next.&nbsp; Two 
rooms must be connected together before exits between them can be modified.</P>
<P>For instance, suppose you linked "MyArea#123" and 
"MyArea#124" as described above.&nbsp; By default, you get an StdOpenDoorway, 
also known as an "Open" exit.&nbsp; These exits can be walked through 
freely.&nbsp; Now suppose you wish to have a Door between the two rooms.&nbsp; 
If the exits between the two rooms are both the same, and you are standing in 
the southernmost room of the two, then changing them both is simply a matter of 
issuing the command "create Door north".</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/createexit.gif" ></P>
<P><STRONG>Destroying 
Exits</STRONG></P>
<P>Just as unlinking rooms disconnects them, destroying 
exits can SEEM to disconnect them.&nbsp; When you issue a simple destroy 
command, and refer specifically to the exit, then you will not be destroying the 
link between the two rooms, but merely the exit that travels between them.&nbsp; 
Archons can still travel through these missing links, but players will not be 
able to.&nbsp; Also, destroying an exit only deletes the exit in one direction, 
not both.&nbsp; For instance, if you are standing in the southerly room of two 
linked rooms that both have Exits between them, and you issue the command 
"destroy exit north", you will destroy the Open exit between the rooms.&nbsp; As 
an Archon, you can still travel north through the destroyed exit, but players 
will not be able to.</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/destroyexit.gif" ></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Now, that an exit has been deleted, it is possible to 
create a DIFFERENT kind of exit for the northerly direction from MyArea#123 to 
MyArea#124.&nbsp; Issuing a create command like "create Door north" will create 
a door that leads from MyArea#123 to MyArea#124, WITHOUT AFFECTING the Open path 
from MyArea#124 to MyArea#123.&nbsp; This is only possible when the exits 
between two rooms are different, or one is deleted, as is our case here.</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/destroyexit3.gif" ></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Now, suppose you wanted to have the same Door going 
between two rooms.&nbsp; For sure this is a more common scenario than the 
example we just went through.&nbsp; To do this, you must first delete BOTH of 
the exits between two rooms as described above. That means entering MyArea#123 
and entering "destroy exit north", and then entering MyArea#124 and entering 
"destroy exit south".&nbsp; </P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/destroyexit2.gif" ></P>
<P>Now, with both exits deleted (and thus the same), you 
can create a single door between them as we did in the first part of this 
section using the "create Door south" command.</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/createexit2.gif" ></P>
<P><STRONG>The "GenExit"</STRONG></P>
<P>As mentioned briefly earlier, the GenExit is an 
undefined exit that one can mold to fit ones needs.&nbsp; Whenever a GenExit is 
created or modified, you will be presented with a series of properties to 
change.&nbsp; Hitting return will leave most of these&nbsp;properties without 
modification.&nbsp; Entering new values will replace the old values.&nbsp; These 
properties include:</P>

      the room, rejuvenates or resets to its proper state.&nbsp; The value 
      '2147483647' or '0'&nbsp;means that the item never rejuvenates, but once 
      picked up and brought out of the room, is gone forever.&nbsp; Any other

saved item in the room, you must re-save the room in order to make the items 
destruction permanent.</P>
<P><STRONG>Creating MOBs</STRONG></P>
<P>Greater even than the mages powerful spells of summoning

      and unless the creature is really nasty (10-20 range), it should be kept 
      at default.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><EM>Alignment </EM></TD>
    <TD>aside from the creatures experience level, this 
      is the most important determinate of whether a player gets experience for 
      killing it.&nbsp; You should make the alignment reflect the creature’s 
      obvious disposition.&nbsp; Making children evil, or a good orc doesn't do 
      anyone any good.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><EM>Money</EM></TD>
    <TD>unless a thief gets it first, this will be the 
      amount of money the creature is carrying.&nbsp; At first level, the number 
      10 is plenty.&nbsp; Again, follow the default.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><EM>Weight </EM></TD>
    <TD>this is only important in determining whether it 
      can be WHOMPed by a fighter.&nbsp; You should make this number reflect the

    <TD>a shopkeeper can sell Anything, General items, 
      Armor, Miscellanous magic items not included amongst armor or weapons, 
      Weapons, Pets, Leather items, Only buys the things he also sells (but 
      sells whatever you give him to sell), Trains players in spells, prayers, 
      skills, or songs, Casts prayers, spells, or songs on the buyer, Potions, 
      Land, and more!&nbsp; All shopkeepers can also buy what they sell,

    <TD>
      <P>This complicated field is where you can adjust the 
      prices the ShopKeeper sells from the programmed normal.&nbsp; An 
      unspecified value here will always return a value of 1.0 (which means NO 
      adjustment).&nbsp; However, you may enter one or more adjustments 
      seperated by semicolons (;).&nbsp; Here is an example:</P>
      <P><FONT face="Courier New" size=2 
      >SELL=5.5 Elf Dwarf ; BUY=0.4 Elf Dwarf ; SELL=1.0 ; 
      BUY=1.0</FONT></P>
      <P>Each adjustment must begin with the words "SELL=" 
      or "BUY=" followed by a Real number designating the adjustment from 
      normal.&nbsp; A value above 1.0 will raise prices.&nbsp; A value below 1.0 
      (like 0.3 or 0.75) will lower prices.&nbsp; Values of 0.0 are NOT 
      allowed.&nbsp; If you need to all but not allow buying and selling, a 
      value of 0.000000001 should do.&nbsp; </P>
      <P>Each adjustment may also contain the name of one 
      or more Racial Categories (Elf, Dwarf, Gnome, Halfing, etc..).&nbsp; If a 
      Racial Category is specified, then the adjustment will ONLY apply to that 
      race.&nbsp; The adjustments are read from left to right, so adjustments 
      without any racial categories should be listed LAST.&nbsp; In the above 
      example, Dwarves and Elves are given a very bad deal, where everyone else 
      gets a normal one.&nbsp; In addition to Racial Categories, you may also 
      list alignments (good, neutral, or evil).&nbsp; Remember that this field 
      is evaluated from left to right, so any matches made&nbsp;on the left that 
      apply to a player will cancel evaluation of the rest of the

<P><STRONG>Destroying MOBs</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>To destroy a MOB&nbsp;that is in the same room as you, 
you need only issue the destroy command.&nbsp;&nbsp;MOBs that have been set to 
rejuv will not do so.&nbsp; If the&nbsp;MOB was a permanently saved&nbsp;MOB in 
the room, you must re-save the room in order to make the MOBs destruction 
permanent.</P>
<P><STRONG>Equipping MOBs</STRONG></P>
<P>You may give a MOB equipment to wear or carry as 
treasure, if this is done properly.&nbsp; First off, you can ONLY equip a 
Generic MOB.&nbsp; This includes the GenMob, GenUndead, and GenShopKeeper.&nbsp; 
No other creature may be saved with equipment.&nbsp; Generic or non-Generic 
Items may be used as equipment.&nbsp; To equip the MOB, first create the items 
you wish to give to your new creature using the procedure described above under 
"Creating Items".&nbsp; Now, you may use the Archon "possess" skill to take 
temporary control of your monster, allowing them to pick up the items you 
created and wear or wield them as necessary.&nbsp; Another way is to "order" the 
mob to pick up the items you created, and then "order" them again to wear or 
wield the items.&nbsp; Either way will accomplish the purpose.<BR><BR><STRONG>Practical Affects, MOB Behaviors<BR><BR></STRONG>Although there are 
exceptions, MOBs will be the primary beneficiary of Behaviors (see above under 
Creating MOBs), and Items (and occasionally Rooms) will benefit from 
Affects.&nbsp; Some of the useful Affects for Rooms are already described above 
under Creating Rooms.&nbsp; For Generic Items, Prop_HaveAdjuster, 
Prop_WearAdjuster, Prop_HaveZapper and others are commonly used.&nbsp; For 
Generic MOBs, you will find many useful Behaviors which will add great depth to 
your MUD.&nbsp; The MudChat behavior may be added to ANY Mob to add an extra 
dimension. "Aggressive", "MOBTeacher", and "Mobile" are also extremely common 
behaviors to give to your MOBs.&nbsp; It is highly recommended that any Archon 
wishing to create a rich and wonderous universe spend time perusing the help 
files to learn of the wonders of the Behaviors and Affects.<BR><BR><STRONG>"Rejuvenating Items and Mobs" or "How to Save a 
Room"</STRONG></P>
<P>MOBs and Items that are created in rooms, even those 
which have had the Rejuv Ticks property set to some reasonable number, will not 
actually begin to rejuvenate, and will not reappear in the room when CoffeeMud 
is rebooted, until the room is saved.&nbsp; To save a room, you must be standing 
in it.&nbsp; From there, you may issue either the "save items" command to reset 
the items in the room, "save mobs" command to reset the mobs in the room, or 
"save room" to reset them both.&nbsp; You should make sure that the items, mobs, 
or both, are exactly the way you want them to be when the system is 
rebooted.&nbsp; Players in the room, including yourself and your followers, will 
be ignored by the command to save the mobs.</P>

<P align=left><U>Weapon 
Groups</U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
When building weapons, you must first select the group that the weapon falls 
under.&nbsp; The weapon group affects which classes can use the weapon, as well 
as what specializations enhance it’s use.&nbsp; Selecting more common weapon 
groups, such as EDGED or SWORD can enable a weapon designer to place higher 
level restrictions, if desired, on the weapon.&nbsp; This increase in levels is 
suggested to be 2 additional levels, but not necessary to keep the game 
balanced.&nbsp; Weapons within a group may deal any TYPE of damage, as discussed 
later, but have general tendencies towards one or two types.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Weapons within a given category have certain general tendencies, as describe by 
the table below.&nbsp; Any or all of these can be overridden for the purpose of 
weapon design, these are just the basic type of weapons in that category.&nbsp; 
For example, flailed weapons tend to be unwieldy (have a negative to attack), 
but that doesn’t mean all flails are unwieldy.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Similarly, the allowed materials are materials used 
historically to make that type of weapon.&nbsp; If a weapon designer deigns to 
make a weapon out of LAMPOIL, it is doable, just a little unorthodox.&nbsp; (You 
would probably want to make the weapon out of GLASS, as that is the outer 
delivery devise of a Molotov Cocktail.)&nbsp; Currently, weapon SIZE has no 
effect on game play, but that may change at a later date.&nbsp; The BASE 
MATERIAL of a weapon assumes that weapons are made from that general area, and 
use material bonuses based on that type.&nbsp; If you create a weapon out of a 
non-standard, ALLOWABLE MATERIAL, use the appropriate charts for determining 
attack and damage bonuses after the level has been set.</P>

<P><U>Determining Weapon Level</U> 
<P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Weapon creation can be done by the designer fixing the DAMAGE that a weapon 
does, or by fixing the LEVEL required to use the weapon.&nbsp; To generate 
weapons that do a specific amount of damage which are balanced with the 
WEAPONSMITHING skills, use the following formula:</P>
<P>Level= ((2*D)/(H+1) + (A-W)/5 +R)*((R/W)+2)+1</P>
<P>where</P>
<P>D=base DAMAGE of the weapon before material 
modifiers,<BR>H=number of hands required to wield<BR>A=base ATTACK bonus of the weapon<BR>R=REACH/RANGE of weapon<BR>W=WEIGHT of 
weapon</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Round the final number down, to a minimum level of 1.&nbsp; Some general 
criteria to follow for weapons to avoid creating ultra-powerful, low-level 
weapons include:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Create the weapon for a HUMAN-sized character first.&nbsp; If you wish to scale 
it up or down for different races, use the WEAPONS FOR GIANTS table after 
setting the base level.&nbsp; A typical one-handed human weapon will weigh from 
1-8 pounds, and a two handed weapon will typically weigh from 10 to 20 
pounds.&nbsp; Using heavier/lighter weapons will create a strange, and possibly 
unbalanced, result.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Melee weapons should not have a reach greater than 1.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Weight of weapons should include any incidental weight in using the item, such 
as carrying case, ammunition, and other equipment generally assumed to be in use 
with the item.&nbsp; For most RANGED weapons, this will add another 4 pounds to 
the typical weight of the weapon.&nbsp; For melee weapons, the weight is 
generally negligible.&nbsp; (Except, possibly for a Katana with a very ornate 
scabbard.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Round the final number down, to a minimum level of 1.</P>

<P>Notice:&nbsp; On the Executioner’s Axe, and the Katana, 
the size does not correspond to the size formula given above.&nbsp; That’s OK, 
since the size isn’t currently used, and since the weapon designer ultimately 
has free reign over weapon design.&nbsp; Also, if you compare many of these 
levels to that of the weaponsmithing skill, you will some discrepancies on the 
levels.&nbsp; Weapon construction isn’t an exact science, as long as you get it 
in the general range the game will remain balanced.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
If you wish to create a weapon based on the level of a MOB, you can use some 
algebra and convert the equation into a damage equation to give you the 
following formula: 
<P>D= ((L-1)/((R/W)+2) + (W-A)/5 -R)*((H+1)/2) 
<P>where 
<P>L=Level required to use weapon,<BR>H=number of hands required to wield<BR>A=base ATTACK bonus of the weapon<BR>R=REACH/RANGE of weapon<BR>W=WEIGHT of

<P>Round the final number down, to a minimum level of

<P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
To compute the weapon’s base value use the following equation: 
<P>Cost of Item= 2*(W*V+(5*D+A+R*10)*D)/(H+1) 
<P>where 
<P>D=base DAMAGE of the weapon before material

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Weapon Damage Type is entirely up to the weapon designer, but some guidelines 
have already been provided for the basic weapon types.&nbsp; Here is a brief 
description of the different damage types, and level modifiers for weapons with 
these damage types: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
NATURAL—All Natural weapons should be UnGettable.&nbsp; Natural weapons are 
available for a creature to use in combat, such as a Manticore’s tail spikes; 
but not actual weapons for adventurer’s to loot.&nbsp; Any GETTABLE Natural 
weapon should have a level MODIFIER of at LEAST it’s DAMAGE rating.&nbsp; 
Natural weapons would be favored by monks if they could get them. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
SLASHING—Slashing weapons are fairly common and include things like Axes and 
Swords.&nbsp; No special care needs to be considered when making a weapon deal 
SLASHING damage.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
PIERCING—Piercing weapons are very common amongst the Polearm groups.&nbsp; No 
special care needs to be considered when making a weapon deal PIERCING 
damage.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
BASHING—Bashing weapons are common amongst Blunt and Hammer weapon groups.&nbsp; 
No special care needs to be considered when making a weapon deal SLASHING 
damage.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
BURNING—This is the damage type for all fire based attacks and spells.&nbsp; 
Burning weapons tend to do more damage to cloth and leather armors, and overall 
are more powerful than Slashing/Piercing/Bashing due to there infrequent use 
amongst weapons.&nbsp; Add 2 levels to a weapon’s base LEVEL if it is of type 
BURNING.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
BURSTING— This is the damage type for all Magic based attacks and spells. 
Bursting are more powerful than Slashing/Piercing/Bashing due to there 
infrequent use amongst weapons.&nbsp; Add 2 levels to a weapon’s base LEVEL if 
it is of type BURSTING.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
SHOOT—This is the damage type of projectile missiles, such as Bows and 
Guns.&nbsp; It is very similar in nature to PIERCING.&nbsp; No special care 
needs to be considered when making a weapon deal SHOOT damage.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
FROSTING—This is the damage type for all Cold based attacks and spells.&nbsp; 
Frosting weapons tend to be more powerful than Slashing/Piercing/Bashing due to 
there infrequent use amongst weapons.&nbsp; Add 2 levels to a weapon’s base 
LEVEL if it is of type FROSTING.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
GASSING—This is the damage type for all Gas based attacks and spells.&nbsp; 
Gassing weapons tend to be more powerful than Slashing/Piercing/Bashing due to 
there infrequent use amongst weapons.&nbsp; Add 2 levels to a weapon’s base 
LEVEL if it is of type GASSING.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
MELTING—This is the damage type for all Acid based attacks and spells.&nbsp; 
Melting weapons tend to do more damage to armors, and overall are more powerful 
than Slashing/Piercing/Bashing due to there infrequent use amongst 
weapons.&nbsp; Add 2 levels to a weapon’s base LEVEL if it is of type 
MELTING.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
STRIKING—This is the damage type for all Electricity based attacks and 
spells.&nbsp; Striking weapons tend to do more damage to cloth and leather 
armors, and overall are more powerful than Slashing/Piercing/Bashing due to 
there infrequent use amongst weapons.&nbsp; Add 2 levels to a weapon’s base 
LEVEL if it is of type STRIKING.</P>
<P><U>Creating Quick and Dirty

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
If you just want to guestimate a weapon’s level or damage, use the following 
formulas.&nbsp; They aren’t very accurate, and can create radically overbalanced 
weapons in the hands of players, but they are great for easy NON-GETTABLE MOB 
weapons. 
<P>LEVEL=DAMAGE + (ATTACK/5) 
<P>or</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
If you wish to create weapons for large (or small) creatures, the weight of the 
item will often get an unusually high bias, creating MASSIVE low level weapons 
with lots of damage potential.&nbsp; Instead, create the weapon for a human 
sized creature, and add the following modifiers.

<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Armor creation is, in many ways, much simpler than weapon creation.&nbsp; There 
are three types of armor: Cloth, Leather, and Metal.&nbsp; Strange armors could 
exist, but are variants of one of these three types.&nbsp; The armor values vary 
by location, and by material.&nbsp; Shields are considered to be HELD METAL 
armor.&nbsp; For a wooden shield, consider it as a HELD LEATHER armor for 
the&nbsp;purposes of&nbsp;further discussion&nbsp;(though your material would 
still be WOODEN). 
<P><U>Armor Points (Not the final 
Defensive value of the armor)</U> 
<P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Different types of armor have different level values, since the less armored 
classes would love to get that extra armor bonus at a lighter weight.&nbsp; To 
keep the classes balanced, the use the following guideline for determining the 
BASE POINT value of an armor piece.&nbsp; As you will see in the next section, 
different WEAR locations will have different ARMOR VALUEs for the same type of 
armor.&nbsp; A platemail breastplate is more protective than a platemail cuff.

<P>&nbsp;The armor weights are recommendations.&nbsp; If 
you wish to create a lighter version of chain mail that gives the same armor 
protection (like Elven Chainmail) go right ahead.&nbsp; It will not increase the 
level, it will increase the COST of the armor.</P>
<P><U>Armor Cost</U> 
<P>
<P></P>
<P>The formula for the cost of the armor is: 
<P>COST = (A*A + V) * ( W/2) 
<P>where</P>
<P>W = Weight of Armor<BR>A&nbsp; = 
Armor Points<BR>V = material Value</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
So our example of an iron Banded Shirt would cost 2173.5 (round up to 2174): 
(7*7+20)*(63/2). 
<P>
<P></P>
<P><U>Final Armor Adjustments</U> 
<P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
After you have computed the Armor Value, consult the materials tables for any 
bonuses that the material may give.&nbsp; This number is a bonus per Armor 
Point.&nbsp; If a breast plate of full plate is made from Adamantite (armor 
bonus of 4), it would gain 12 (4*3) points of protection, bringing it’s total 
value from 30 (10*3) to 42. (30 + 12).&nbsp; Material modifiers do NOT affect 
the level of the armor, even though it would have an effective Armor Point total 
of 14, it would still be available at level 23!&nbsp; Consult the Material 
Modifiers section below for an Armor Point reference.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Magic should be controlled by the type of MUD that is being run.&nbsp; If you 
run a low-fantasy MUD, you may wish to increase the Level requirement for items 
with magical properties.&nbsp; If you are on a high-fantasy MUD, you may wish to 
decrease the Level requirements for items with magical properties.&nbsp; Magic 
comes in at least seven forms:&nbsp; Magic Adjustment, <EM>PropFightSpellCast, PropHaveSpellCast, PropWearSpellCast, 
PropHaveAdjustor, PropWearAdjuster, PropHaveResistor, PropWearResistor</EM>. 
<P><U>Magic Adjustment</U> 
<P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This field is available on any item, weapon or armor.&nbsp; If the item can be 
worn (but not used as a weapon), then every point of magic gives 1 point of 
Armor Value.&nbsp; If the item can be used as a weapon, then it gives +2 to 
Damage, and +10 to Attack per point of bonus.&nbsp; In either case, the magic 
adjustment improves the item’s saving throws against attacks that damage it’s 
condition.&nbsp; Having a Magic Adjustment greater than 0 makes the item magical 
(and detectable as such).&nbsp; Every 1 point of magic adjustment is worth 5 
additional levels to the base level of the item. 
<P><EM>PropFightSpellCast</EM> 
<P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This property will make a weapon discharge a spell affect with each successful 
hit.&nbsp; As such, it is very powerful, and the weapon’s level should be 
increased by twice the spell’s typical level.&nbsp; As with all spell effects, 
use careful judgment when placing spells on items, and use your own discretion 
for determining the final level adjustment. 
<P><EM>PropHaveSpellCast</EM> 
<P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
By simply having this item, the designated spell is cast on the owner.&nbsp; If 
this is a positive effect, add the Spell effect’s typical level to the level of 
the item (at least, depending on usefulness).&nbsp; If having a stone of 
Invisibility (level 7) is enough to make you invisible, then the stone should 
require at least a level 7 character (if it did nothing else).&nbsp; On 
something as powerful as invisibility, you may wish to increase the level even 
more. 
<P><EM>PropWearSpellCast</EM> 
<P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This property makes any worn/wielded item grant the effects of a spell.&nbsp; As 
a general rule, the item’s level should be increased by half of the spell’s 
typical level.&nbsp; Again, use your own discretion when creating items that may 
be very powerful, such as stoneskin or invisibility. 
<P><EM>PropHaveAdjustor</EM> 
<P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This property makes an item that is in a MOBs possession gain certain 
abilities.&nbsp; This is a very powerful effect, since a MOB could conceivably 
carry a lot of these items.&nbsp; The level increase for items of this type 
should be at least twice as high as those with the PropWearAdjustor affect. 
<P><EM>PropWearAdjustor</EM> 
<P>
<P></P>
<P>This property makes a worn/wielded item grant special 
benefits to it’s owner.</P>

There are many properties available in Coffeemud that enable unique item 
creation.&nbsp; There are inhibiting properties such as the <EM>PropWearZapper</EM> and <EM>PropHaveZapper</EM> that can be used to reduce the level of 
the item (I would say as a general rule, for every race restricted, reduce the 
level requirement by 2, and for every class restricted reduce the level by 
1.)&nbsp; Other spell affects may be negative, reducing the value of the 
item.&nbsp; Still others may be difficult to determine their effects, reducing 
the value of the item.&nbsp; Use your judgment, or request the system owner’s 
advice for particularly complicated works of magic. </P>
<P align=left><U>Cost of Magical and 
Miscelaneous Properties</U>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
For determining the added monetary value of an item based on its magical 
properties, you must first determine how prevelant magic items will be in your 
world. Choose a cost Index between *10 for a magic rich world, to *100 for a 
magic poor world. Each level above the base level is multiplied by this Index 
and then added to the base cost to determine its final value.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Final Cost = Base Cost + (Total Level Increase)*(cost Index)</P>
<P></P>
<P align=left><U>Material 
Modifiers</U>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The Material that you use to create an item affects it’s overall effectiveness 
without affecting it’s level.&nbsp; Make these modifications to the item AFTER 
completing the previous formulas.&nbsp; If you use a non-standard material, do 
not apply the actual material modifiers (other than value) to the item’s Attack, 
Damage, or Armor values.&nbsp; A metal club is superior to a wooden club, but 
using a better type of metal doesn’t increase the bluntness (or even relative 
hardness) of the club significantly.&nbsp; ROCK is an exception to this 
rule.</P>

Once an item is completed, add any values from materials to the end result to 
get the final values for the item.&nbsp; Note that CONDITION is a relative term 
that determines ARMOR and WEAPON damage condition.&nbsp; Different types of 
materials suffer differently from the various attack forms.&nbsp; A blank in 
this area means that it resists damage normally, and wears at the standard rate 
for all attacks against that type of material.&nbsp; A ‘+’ means that it holds 
up better against all forms of attacks.&nbsp; A ‘-‘ means that it suffers more 
damage from all forms of attacks.&nbsp; 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Mithril is a special type of METAL.&nbsp; Therefore, any item that can be made 
from a metal, can also be made from a mithril.&nbsp; Mithril has different 
resistance scores than metals, and has other special properties, so it is listed 
as its own classification.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
If an item is created from a non-standard material, apply those modifiers 
FIRST.&nbsp; If they don’t allow for a MATERIAL MODIFIER, then skip this 
step.</P>

<P align=left><FONT color=darkviolet size=4><STRONG>Q. How can I get mobs into 
Grid areas?</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT color=black><STRONG>A.</STRONG> Locale types like 
MountainsGrid, WoodsGrid, WoodsMaze, PlainsGrid, DesertMaze, etc.. can all 
contain rejuvinating mobs in them.&nbsp; However, two rules need to be followed 
for this to work properly.&nbsp; The first is that you can only save mobs which 
are in the parent Grid room itself.&nbsp; If you have SYSMSGS on, you can tell 
which room this is because it is the only one with a valid room ID 
("MyArea#123") in the description.&nbsp; The child rooms will have blank () room 
IDs.&nbsp; Since no one ever actually walks into the parent Grid room, the only 
way to get to it to deposit mobs is using the Archon GOTO command.&nbsp; The 
second of the two rules is that you must give the mob the Mobile behavior.&nbsp; 
The mobile behavior is specially coded so that it will take the mob to a random 
room inside the grid the first time the mob tries to move.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P align=left><STRONG><FONT 
color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. How does the CoffeeMud News feature 
work?</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG> 
Messages can be posted that will appear automatically at login time for those 
who have not yet read them.&nbsp; This is done by creating a "GenJournal" item 
and giving it the name "CoffeeMud News".&nbsp; Any messages posted to such a 
journal will appear at login time.&nbsp; This journal can either be made 
available to players, or restricted to Archons as you like.</P>
<P align=left><STRONG><FONT 
color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. How to Clans 
work?</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG> 
First, you need to make a StdClanMaster MOB somewhere in the world to create 
clans. A player would see him, and use the 'clancreate' command to create their 
new clan.&nbsp;The StdClanMaster then&nbsp;puts your clan into a pending state 
awaiting new members. You have to get at least MINCLANMEMBERS amount of new 
members before it will activate you (Set in the INI file). Activation means you 
will be visible in the listing, can buy land, can have bank accounts, and can 
hire mobs, as well as have politics with others</P>
<P align=left>Once you've made your clan, people can 
'clanapply' to the clan. Of course, the person has to be at least level 
MINCLANLEVEL (Set in the INI file). 'clanapply' can be done even if you're the 
only one online. Clan bosses and leaders will see new applicants in their 
'clandetails' screen, at which point, they can 'clanaccept' or 'clanreject' the 
player (regardless of online status). Clan bosses can also 'clanassign' people 
roles, such as treasurer, leader, or even boss. Clan bosses and leaders may, at 
any time, 'clanexile' a member - as well as members can 'clanresign' </P>
<P align=left>Once you're accepted into a clan, you can use 
the clantalk channel to talk to your clan, as well as use the 'clanhome' spell 
and the 'clandonate' command. The 'clanhome' location and the 'clandonate' 
location can be set by bosses using the 'clanhomeset' and 'clandonateset' 
commands. Bosses and treasurers may use 'clanbalance', 'clandeposit' or 
'clanwithdraw' at any banker to access an account with that chain. The great 
thing is, as long as there is at least one ClanMaster in the world, if 
MINCLANMEMBERS don't at least login in DAYSCLANDEATH days, then the clan will be 
purged automatically. </P>
<P align=left><STRONG><FONT 
color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. What does Hunger/Thirst/Fatigue 
affect? </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG> 
Neglecting to eat or drink can put a player into a state of hunger or thirst 
respectively.&nbsp; Failing to sleep for days on end can cause fatigue. Each of 
these will lower attack rating, armor rating,&nbsp;and damage 
capabilities.&nbsp; Hunger and Thirst will also decrease the rate at which hit 
points, movement, and mana are regained.&nbsp; Lastly, remaining Hungry or 
Thirsty for too long will result in death, though there will be plenty of 
warnings from the system before it happens.</P>
