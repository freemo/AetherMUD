<UL>
<LI>ANSI support is new
<LI>CoffeeMud now has a web server!  Yipee!
<LI>Add Area objects and Tables and Affect/Properties!
<LI>Allow classes and directories to be assigned in the INI file in addition to the default path.
<LI>Create a custom command ability, include ability to override existing commands!
<LI>Add Notes abilities -- really need for bug fix reporting! Done this way: a Journal can be read, it will 
	list the posts for a given Journal.  
<LI>Druid : a good new base class
<LI>hit and miss strings in the Weapon.  Natural Weapons can also be retreived from MOBs, or from Races by default.
<LI>From Maree: (Game/Heath Texts), the descriptions for the health of a MOB should be moved to a text file (A resource?), that is loaded.  The descriptions would be assigned to the MOB at build time, and should be assignable to GENMOBS via a new tag.
<LI>ranged combat?!Yes!And thrown weapons<LI>And ranged pole-arms!
<LI>Add CoffeeMud area files!can import and export rooms or areas
<LI>Languages! Affects says and replies if you don't know a language spoken by the speaker.
<LI>Make mountable MOBS, and mountable Items. Mounted animals will take half of all combat damage, will add to attack ability, and increase movement and will act as a container for the purposes of cargo.  Mounted Items will not appear in inventory, and be restrained to a terrain type (air, water, etc).  More than one person can mount an item (a boat).  
<LI>Armor damage/repair, especially cloth from fire, and metal armor from bludgeoning/leather armor from slashing.  
<LI>banks!(Well, the moneychanger behavior is good enough).
<LI>exp from sac/des also based on level of the body.  Set body levels based on char level.
<LI>Serve and Rebuke commands.  Any character may take on a leige. A Leige receives 10% of all experience gained by the vassels, providing incentive to assist the vassel.
<LI>Weapon condition, sharpness, and bluntness Weapon repair and sharpening/blunting.

<LI>Convert some properties to work with the new areas. Prop_NOMOB, etc..
<LI>make room properties also work for exits
<LI>Multi-Room Item Transporter.  Have a TeleportingContainer that, whenever anything is inside it, it will send the items to the appropriate GateObject.  The GateObject can be either a container or not. If not, the GateObject will drop its cargo on the floor.  The TeleportingContainer and the GateObject will have identical MiscText fields to establish the Keys between them.
<LI>Forget spell to make someone forget a skill they try, at random!
<LI>Predict Weather spell
<LI>Multi-Room Gate would work the same way.  An Entry, Exit, and TwoWay type would be constructed.  The Entry type would accept "ENTER" commands from MOBs, and drag all followers along, of course.  The  Following thing would be automatic, if an Exit and Direction extensions are used.
