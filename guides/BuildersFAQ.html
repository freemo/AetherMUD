<p align="left"><strong><font color="#9400d3" size="4"></font></strong><br>
<font color="darkviolet" size="4"><strong>Q. What should I know to run a
 CoffeeMUD?</strong></font><br>
<br>
A. Well, for starters, if you're going to run  it on your computer and you
don't know how to setup a firewall with port  forwarding, you will have a
tough time (and our group isn't *really* a network  support group, so we're
not top-notch at helping folks with their network  troubles).<br>
<br>
Secondly, if you plan to do anything clever, different, or  otherwise doing
anything that isn't using what is within the system already, you  will either
need to know some basic Java coding OR be able to bribe a Java savvy  friend
with beer.<br>
<br>
You should also have some idea about what you want to  have in your game.&nbsp;
Yes, I know this sounds obvious, but it gets  overlooked.&nbsp; CoffeeMUD
supports Fantasy based games, so you will want to  bear that in mind.&nbsp;
In progress is support for Sci-Fi games, but it is a  work in progress that
is in its early stages.<br>
<br>
<font color="darkviolet" size="4"><strong>Q. Can I add Northeast, southwest,
etc?&nbsp; What supports  it?</strong></font><br>
<br>
A. Yes, haven't you read the INI help descriptions  yet?&nbsp; DIRECTIONS=7
can be changed to DIRECTIONS=11, thereby enabling  Northeast, Northwest,
southeast, and southwest. <br>
<br>
<font color="darkviolet"><font size="4"><strong>Q. Where do suggestions,
questions, and  bugs go?</strong></font><br>
</font><br>
A: Well, best bet for questions,  suggestions, and bugs is to email <a
 href="mailto:coffeemud@yahoogroups.com">coffeemud@yahoogroups.com</a>.&nbsp;
 Many times people will expand on suggestions or have fixes for bugs for
you  pretty quickly.<br>
<br>
<font color="darkviolet" size="4"><strong>Q. Does CoffeeMUD  support Remorting?<br>
</strong></font><br>
A. Yes, in its own way.&nbsp; Here is  the HELP REMORT entry:<br>
Remorting requires careful planning and, if you don't  have the benefits
of certain Druidic chants, lots of time.&nbsp; Remorting is  done through
your children.&nbsp; Children are created by using the MATE social  with
a member of the opposite sex while the both of you are suitably  undressed.&nbsp;
If pregnancy occurs in the female, birth will occur some 10  mud-months following
this.&nbsp; The child should remain in the mothers  inventory until it can
walk, which occurs 9 mud- months following birth.&nbsp;  If the child is
Christened by a Cleric with a player legal name, and if the  child remains
as a follower of either the father or the mother until it grows  up, it will
become a player, which occurs 18-27 mud-months after birth.&nbsp; If  the
child does not remain an active follower, or if it is never Christened, it
 will grow up to be a mob, or perhaps not grow up at all! Should the named
child  grow up, the child will cease to be a following mob, and become a
player which  can be logged-in as.&nbsp; The child may be a mixed breed of
the mother and  father if one of them is a Human and the other is not.&nbsp;
Racial benefits  will be split between the mother and father, though children
will have a bonus  to their maximum stats when they become a player, making
them a good choice for  playing!<br>
<br>
If you are looking for that traditional remort concept revolving  around
classes, it is not supported. But you can accomplish that through setting
 the INI CLASSYSTEM=MULTI, then do a bit of code changing within your class
 files.&nbsp; For example, you might have &#8216;Super Wizard&#8217; or something.&nbsp;
In  that class file:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; public boolean qualifiesForThisClass(MOB  mob, boolean quiet)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  if((mob.charStats().getClassLevel(&#8220;Wizard&#8221;)&lt;30)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &amp;&amp;(mob.charStats().getClassLevel(&#8220;Power
 Wizard&#8221;)&lt;30))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  if(!quiet)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mob.tell("You  aren't a
master of wizardry yet.");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  return false;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return  true;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
<br>
In that case, the player would have to have 30  levels in both &#8220;Wizard&#8221; and
&#8220;Power Wizard&#8221; to qualify for the &#8220;Super Wizard&#8221;  CharClass.<br>
<br>
<font color="darkviolet" size="4"><strong>Q. Does CoffeeMUD have a  Building
Port?</strong></font><br>
<br>
A. No, there is no separate port for world  content creation.&nbsp; All building
tools are on-line realtime.&nbsp; It is  easy to export and import areas,
so you can run more than one copy.&nbsp; This  can be essential if you are
also making coding changes, which will often require  reboots.<br>
<br>
<font color="darkviolet" size="4"><strong>Q. Does CoffeeMUD have any  other
combat options besides normal and QUEUE?</strong></font><br>
<br>
A: Not as  part of the base code.&nbsp; However, Matthew (roguestar191@comcast.net),
a  member of the CoffeeMUD Yahoo Group, has developed a patch that enables
more  flexibility in combat control.&nbsp; It can be found in the Files section
at  http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/coffeemud/files/<br>
<br>
<font color="darkviolet"><strong><font size="4">Q. What databases can CoffeeMUD
work  with?</font><br>
</strong></font><br>
A:&nbsp;Anything ODBC friendly.&nbsp; It  comes with a flat file system called
FakeDB so you don't have to setup a  database if you want.&nbsp; However,
products like MySQL and HSQLDB make the  system run much faster.<br>
<br>
<strong><font color="#9400d3" size="4">Q. How to  Clans work?</font></strong></p>
 
<p align="left"><strong>A.</strong> First, you need to&nbsp;use the clancreate
 command to create a new clan.&nbsp;You have to get at least MINCLANMEMBERS
 amount of new members before it will activate you (Set in the INI file).
 Activation means you will be visible in the listing, can buy land for the
clan,  can have clan bank accounts, and can hire mobs, as well as have politics
with  others.</p>
 
<p align="left">Once you've made your clan, people can 'clanapply' to the
clan. Of  course, the person has to be at least level MINCLANLEVEL (Set in
the INI file).  'clanapply' can be done even if you're the only one online.
Clan bosses can set  qualifications to the clan with the 'clanqual' command
and both bosses and  leaders will see new applicants in their 'clandetails'
screen, at which point,  they can 'clanaccept' or 'clanreject' the player
(regardless of online status).  Clan bosses can also 'clanassign' people
roles, such as treasurer, leader, or  even boss. Clan bosses and leaders
may, at any time, 'clanexile' a member - as  well as members can 'clanresign'
</p>
 
<p align="left">Once you're accepted into a clan, you can use the clantalk
channel  to talk to your clan, as well as use the 'Clan Home'&nbsp;and 'Clan
Donate'  spells. The 'clanhome' location and the 'clandonate' location can
be set by  bosses using the 'clanhomeset' and 'clandonateset' commands. Clan
morgues can be  designated with the 'clanmorgueset' command. Bosses and treasurers
may deal with  any Clan bankers and Clan Postmen in your game. If MINCLANMEMBERS
don't at least  login in DAYSCLANDEATH days, then the clan will be purged
automatically. </p>

 color="#9400d3" size="4">Q. Can I make rooms available for players to  purchase?&nbsp;
Can players have homes?</font></strong></span></span></span></span></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span class="453251818-08032003"><strong>A.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.&nbsp;
And there are  a ton of ways to do it.&nbsp; The most common way is to create
a special Area  for player homes, put some rooms in it which you want to
be for sale, and then  add either Prop_RoomForSale, Prop_RoomsForSale&nbsp;or
Prop_LotsForSale to each  room as a property.&nbsp; Then, in the same area
(but not in one of your rooms  for sale!), put a shopkeeper that sells either
Clan&nbsp;Homes/Land or Player  Homes/Land.&nbsp; This will force the shopkeeper
to keep an updated inventory of  titles to rooms available for sale.</span></p>
 
<p align="left"><strong><font color="#9400d3" size="4">Q. What does  Hunger/Thirst/Fatigue
affect? </font></strong></p>
 
<p align="left"><strong>A.</strong> Neglecting to eat or drink can put a
player  into a state of hunger or thirst respectively.&nbsp; Failing to sleep
for days  on end can cause fatigue. Each of these will lower attack rating,
armor  rating,&nbsp;and damage capabilities.&nbsp; Hunger and Thirst will
also decrease  the rate at which hit points, movement, and mana are regained.&nbsp;
Lastly,  remaining Hungry or Thirsty for too long will result in death, though
there will  be plenty of warnings from the system before it happens.</p>
 
<p align="left"><strong><font color="#9400d3" size="4">Q. How can I make
mobs  talk/answer questions? </font></strong></p>
 
<p align="left"><strong>A.</strong> Luckily, a great document has already
been  provided for the useful things which can be accomplished with the MudChat
 behavior. <a href="MudChat.html">Here it is.</a> </p>
 
<p align="left"><strong><font color="#9400d3" size="4">Q. How do player Tattoos
work?  </font></strong></p>
 
<p align="left"><strong>A.</strong><font color="black"> Tattoo's are intended
to act  as miscellaneous flags which players may obtain, like a quest point.&nbsp;
These  tattoo's can then be checked for as requirements to enter rooms or
exits using  Prop_ReqTattoo, or using Prop_ReqEntry.&nbsp; Prop_HaveZapper
 and&nbsp;Prop_WearZapper can also be used to check for tattoos.</font></p>
 
<div><span class="453251818-08032003"><font color="black">An example would
be like  this:&nbsp; The completion of a specific quest occurs when Gunther
defeats the  evil sorcerer Nunder and enters his inner chamber (where all
the treasure is  hidden).&nbsp; Entering this inner chamber automatically
grants Gunther a Tatto  called "NUNDERKILLER" because Prop_TattooAdder was
on the room as a  property.&nbsp; Now, elsewhere in the realm is the second
quest where Nunder's  apprentice has escaped with an ancient artifact and
is up to no good.&nbsp;  However, to even ENTER the area where Nunder's apprentice
is operating, the  system (via the Prop_ReqTattoo property on this other
Area) requires that  Gunther already have the "NUNDERKILLER" Tattoo.&nbsp;
If Gunther had not  defeated Nunder, he would not be allowed into the realm
of Nunder's  apprentice.</font></span></div>

 size="4"><br>
Q.  How do I make poisonous drinks? </font></strong></span></div>
 
<div> 
<p align="left"><strong>A.</strong> The best way to "mix a drink" is to make
a  GenPotion item, and add the relevant Poison_* as the potion spell effect.
 Another way is to make a GenDrink item, add the Poison_ as an effect.</p>
 
<div><span class="453251818-08032003"> 
<p align="left"><strong><font color="#9400d3" size="4">Q. How do I make other
Archons?  </font></strong></p>
 
<p align="left"><strong>A.</strong> Using your existing Archon, issue the
command  "create item ManualArchon".&nbsp; Then have your&nbsp;other player&nbsp;get
the  manual and read it.</p>
 
<div><span class="453251818-08032003"> 
<p align="left"><strong><font color="#9400d3" size="4">Q. How do I make materials
that  the Common Skills can use? </font></strong></p>
 
<p align="left"><strong>A.</strong> Make sure you create a GenResource,  GenLiquidResource,
or GenFoodResource item.&nbsp; Only items of this sort will  be recognized
as raw materials by the common skills.</p>
 
<p align="left"><span class="453251818-08032003"><strong><font

<p align="left"><strong>A.</strong>&nbsp;Equipment which is placed on a mob
and  designated as variable will not disapear so long&nbsp;as an Archon,
or anyone  else with CMDROOMS or ORDER security privileges&nbsp;is the in

<p align="left"><span class="453251818-08032003"><strong><font
 color="#9400d3" size="4">Q. How do I make a Classless version of CoffeeMud?</font></strong></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><strong>A.</strong>&nbsp; The coffeemud.ini file has a parameter
 called DISABLE.&nbsp; If CLASSES is added to the disable parameter, then
 CoffeeMud will skip the class selection process at logon, and automatically
set  the player to the normally dormant class called "PlayerClass".&nbsp;
This class,  by default, qualifies for all skills.&nbsp; If you'd like to
have the  PlayerClass qualify for only a certain subset of skills, you will
need to either  modify PlayerClass.java, or create a new GenCharClass called
"PlayerClass" and  give it your own set of skills to qualify for.&nbsp; If
you want, you can create  certain races for which there is no character class
by setting the CLASSLESS  flag within your GenRace or custom coded Race.&nbsp;
This will also skip the  class selection process for new players, and automatically
select a class which  (despite the DISABLE flag) the race qualifies for.&nbsp;
See StdRace.java for  how to code the classless() flag in races.&nbsp; See
the section on  GenCharClasses above for information on racial class qualifying.</p>
 
<p align="left"><span class="453251818-08032003"><strong><font
 color="#9400d3" size="4">Q. How do I make a&nbsp;Levelless version of  CoffeeMud</font></strong></span></p>
 
<p align="left"><strong>A.</strong>&nbsp; The coffeemud.ini file has a parameter
 called DISABLE.&nbsp; If LEVELS is added to the disable parameter, then
 CoffeeMud will not allow any player to gain or lose levels, either magically
or  through normal means, despite any experience points that may be gained
or  lost.&nbsp; Individual classes and races can also be designated as being
 "levelless" through either coding custom classes and races, or through the
 GenRace/GenCharClass creation process. See StdRace.java or  StdCharClass.java&nbsp;for
how to code the classless() flag in java.&nbsp; See  the section on GenCharClasses
or GenRaces&nbsp;above for information on how to  do it through that interface.&nbsp;
Note that adding LEVELS to the DISABLE flag  does not prevent gaining or
losing experience, but just the leveling  consequences.</p>

 One is to place Chant_Unbreakable on the item as&nbsp;permanent  Effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another

 only kinds of food that rot are those from the class GenFoodResource, which
are  materials FLESH or VEGETATION.&nbsp; The easiest way to make food that

<p align="left"><span class="453251818-08032003"><strong>A.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes,
 check out the Regional Awareness skill.&nbsp; It is restricted in the base
 distribution, but can easily be made generally available to all players.&nbsp;
 Just open up the file com/planet_ink/coffee_mud/CharClasses/StdCharClass.java
 amd&nbsp;find the method called "public StdCharClass()" and add the following
 line to the list therein: </span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span class="453251818-08032003"><strong><font size="2">CMAble.addCharAbilityMapping("All",1,"Skill_RegionalAwareness",false);</font></strong>
 </span></p>
 
<p align="left"><span class="453251818-08032003">After doing the above, you'll
need  to recompile StdCharClass.java before rebooting your mud.&nbsp; See
the  Programmer's Guide for more information on rebuilding  CoffeeMud.</span></p>

<p align="left"><span class="453251818-08032003"><strong>A.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes,
 in&nbsp;several different ways.&nbsp; One is for the player to gain the
 Marketeering skill.&nbsp; This allows them to become shopkeepers, sell their
 goods, and set prices for their goods.&nbsp; Another is to "purchase" a
 ShopKeeper-type mob being sold with the property Prop_Retainable.&nbsp;
A mob  sold with that property will take up permanent residence at the players
home,  and sell the items that are given to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Money
made in this  way will go to a bank account (see StdBanker) held by the owner
of the  property.&nbsp; A third way is through Conquest.&nbsp; If the player
belongs to  a Clan, and that clan conquers an Area which has the Conquerable
Behavior on it,  the shopkeepers therein will become beholden to the leaders
of that clan,  selling any items they give to them.</span></p>

<p align="left"><span class="453251818-08032003"><strong>A.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.&nbsp;
Put a healer  mob up for sale at a shop.&nbsp; The healer mob should have
the appropriate  behaviors and skills to make them a healer (such as Healer,
or NiceAbilities  behaviors) and the Prop_Retainable property.&nbsp; That
last will make it so  that the player is forced to pay the mob for his services,
and makes sure that  the mob is saved at the players home.</span></p>
