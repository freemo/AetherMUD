<P align=left><STRONG><FONT color=#9400d3 size=4></FONT></STRONG><BR><FONT 
color=darkviolet size=4><STRONG>Q. What should I know to run a 
CoffeeMUD?</STRONG></FONT><BR><BR>A. Well, for starters, if you're going to run 
it on your computer and you don't know how to setup a firewall with port 
forwarding, you will have a tough time (and our group isn't *really* a network 
support group, so we're not top-notch at helping folks with their network 
troubles).<BR><BR>Secondly, if you plan to do anything clever, different, or 
otherwise doing anything that isn't using what is within the system already, you 
will either need to know some basic Java coding OR be able to bribe a Java savvy 
friend with beer.<BR><BR>You should also have some idea about what you want to 
have in your game.&nbsp; Yes, I know this sounds obvious, but it gets 
overlooked.&nbsp; CoffeeMUD supports Fantasy based games, so you will want to 
bear that in mind.&nbsp; In progress is support for Sci-Fi games, but it is a 
work in progress that is in its early stages.<BR><BR><FONT color=darkviolet 
size=4><STRONG>Q. Can I add Northeast, southwest, etc?&nbsp; What supports 
it?</STRONG></FONT><BR><BR>A. Yes, haven't you read the INI help descriptions 
yet?&nbsp; DIRECTIONS=7 can be changed to DIRECTIONS=11, thereby enabling 
Northeast, Northwest, southeast, and southwest. <BR><BR><FONT 
color=darkviolet><FONT size=4><STRONG>Q. Where do suggestions, questions, and 
bugs go?</STRONG></FONT><BR></FONT><BR>A: Well, best bet for questions, 
suggestions, and bugs is to email <A 
href="mailto:coffeemud@yahoogroups.com">coffeemud@yahoogroups.com</A>.&nbsp; 
Many times people will expand on suggestions or have fixes for bugs for you 
pretty quickly.<BR><BR><FONT color=darkviolet size=4><STRONG>Q. Does CoffeeMUD 
support Remorting?<BR></STRONG></FONT><BR>A. Yes, in its own way.&nbsp; Here is 
the HELP REMORT entry:<BR>Remorting requires careful planning and, if you don't 
have the benefits of certain Druidic chants, lots of time.&nbsp; Remorting is 
done through your children.&nbsp; Children are created by using the MATE social 
with a member of the opposite sex while the both of you are suitably 
undressed.&nbsp; If pregnancy occurs in the female, birth will occur some 10 
mud-months following this.&nbsp; The child should remain in the mothers 
inventory until it can walk, which occurs 9 mud- months following birth.&nbsp; 
If the child is Christened by a Cleric with a player legal name, and if the 
child remains as a follower of either the father or the mother until it grows 
up, it will become a player, which occurs 18-27 mud-months after birth.&nbsp; If 
the child does not remain an active follower, or if it is never Christened, it 
will grow up to be a mob, or perhaps not grow up at all! Should the named child 
grow up, the child will cease to be a following mob, and become a player which 
can be logged-in as.&nbsp; The child may be a mixed breed of the mother and 
father if one of them is a Human and the other is not.&nbsp; Racial benefits 
will be split between the mother and father, though children will have a bonus 
to their maximum stats when they become a player, making them a good choice for 
playing!<BR><BR>If you are looking for that traditional remort concept revolving 
around classes, it is not supported. But you can accomplish that through setting 
the INI CLASSYSTEM=MULTI, then do a bit of code changing within your class 
files.&nbsp; For example, you might have ‘Super Wizard’ or something.&nbsp; In 
that class file:<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; public boolean qualifiesForThisClass(MOB 
mob, boolean quiet)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; {<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
if((mob.charStats().getClassLevel(“Wizard”)&lt;30)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&amp;&amp;(mob.charStats().getClassLevel(“Power 
Wizard”)&lt;30))<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
{<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
if(!quiet)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mob.tell("You 
aren't a master of wizardry yet.");<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
return false;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return 
true;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; }<BR><BR>In that case, the player would have to have 30 
levels in both “Wizard” and “Power Wizard” to qualify for the “Super Wizard” 
CharClass.<BR><BR><FONT color=darkviolet size=4><STRONG>Q. Does CoffeeMUD have a 
Building Port?</STRONG></FONT><BR><BR>A. No, there is no separate port for world 
content creation.&nbsp; All building tools are on-line realtime.&nbsp; It is 
easy to export and import areas, so you can run more than one copy.&nbsp; This 
can be essential if you are also making coding changes, which will often require 
reboots.<BR><BR><FONT color=darkviolet size=4><STRONG>Q. Does CoffeeMUD have any 
other combat options besides normal and QUEUE?</STRONG></FONT><BR><BR>A: Not as 
part of the base code.&nbsp; However, Matthew (roguestar191@comcast.net), a 
member of the CoffeeMUD Yahoo Group, has developed a patch that enables more 
flexibility in combat control.&nbsp; It can be found in the Files section at 
http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/coffeemud/files/<BR><BR><FONT 
color=darkviolet><STRONG><FONT size=4>Q. What databases can CoffeeMUD work 
with?</FONT><BR></STRONG></FONT><BR>A:&nbsp;Anything ODBC friendly.&nbsp; It 
comes with a flat file system called FakeDB so you don't have to setup a 
database if you want.&nbsp; However, products like MySQL and HSQLDB make the 
system run much faster.<BR><BR><STRONG><FONT color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. How to 
Clans work?</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG> First, you need to&nbsp;use the clancreate 
command to create a new clan.&nbsp;You have to get at least MINCLANMEMBERS 
amount of new members before it will activate you (Set in the INI file). 
Activation means you will be visible in the listing, can buy land for the clan, 
can have clan bank accounts, and can hire mobs, as well as have politics with 
others.</P>
<P align=left>Once you've made your clan, people can 'clanapply' to the clan. Of 
course, the person has to be at least level MINCLANLEVEL (Set in the INI file). 
'clanapply' can be done even if you're the only one online. Clan bosses can set 
qualifications to the clan with the 'clanqual' command and both bosses and 
leaders will see new applicants in their 'clandetails' screen, at which point, 
they can 'clanaccept' or 'clanreject' the player (regardless of online status). 
Clan bosses can also 'clanassign' people roles, such as treasurer, leader, or 
even boss. Clan bosses and leaders may, at any time, 'clanexile' a member - as 
well as members can 'clanresign' </P>
<P align=left>Once you're accepted into a clan, you can use the clantalk channel 
to talk to your clan, as well as use the 'Clan Home'&nbsp;and 'Clan Donate' 
spells. The 'clanhome' location and the 'clandonate' location can be set by 
bosses using the 'clanhomeset' and 'clandonateset' commands. Clan morgues can be 
designated with the 'clanmorgueset' command. Bosses and treasurers may deal with 
any Clan bankers and Clan Postmen in your game. If MINCLANMEMBERS don't at least 
login in DAYSCLANDEATH days, then the clan will be purged automatically. </P>

color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. Can I make rooms available for players to 
purchase?&nbsp; Can players have homes?</FONT></STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P align=left><SPAN 
class=453251818-08032003><STRONG>A.</STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.&nbsp; And there are 
a ton of ways to do it.&nbsp; The most common way is to create a special Area 
for player homes, put some rooms in it which you want to be for sale, and then 
add either Prop_RoomForSale, Prop_RoomsForSale&nbsp;or Prop_LotsForSale to each 
room as a property.&nbsp; Then, in the same area (but not in one of your rooms 
for sale!), put a shopkeeper that sells either Clan&nbsp;Homes/Land or Player 
Homes/Land.&nbsp; This will force the shopkeeper to keep an updated inventory of 
titles to rooms available for sale.</SPAN></P></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN>
<P align=left><STRONG><FONT color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. What does 
Hunger/Thirst/Fatigue affect? </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG> Neglecting to eat or drink can put a player 
into a state of hunger or thirst respectively.&nbsp; Failing to sleep for days 
on end can cause fatigue. Each of these will lower attack rating, armor 
rating,&nbsp;and damage capabilities.&nbsp; Hunger and Thirst will also decrease 
the rate at which hit points, movement, and mana are regained.&nbsp; Lastly, 
remaining Hungry or Thirsty for too long will result in death, though there will 
be plenty of warnings from the system before it happens.</P>
<P align=left><STRONG><FONT color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. How can I make mobs 
talk/answer questions? </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG> Luckily, a great document has already been 
provided for the useful things which can be accomplished with the MudChat 
behavior. <A href="MudChat.html">Here it is.</A> </P>
<P align=left><STRONG><FONT color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. How do player Tattoos work? 
</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG><FONT color=black> Tattoo's are intended to act 
as miscellaneous flags which players may obtain, like a quest point.&nbsp; These 
tattoo's can then be checked for as requirements to enter rooms or exits using 
Prop_ReqTattoo, or using Prop_ReqEntry.&nbsp; Prop_HaveZapper 
and&nbsp;Prop_WearZapper can also be used to check for tattoos.</FONT></P>
<DIV><SPAN class=453251818-08032003><FONT color=black>An example would be like 
this:&nbsp; The completion of a specific quest occurs when Gunther defeats the 
evil sorcerer Nunder and enters his inner chamber (where all the treasure is 
hidden).&nbsp; Entering this inner chamber automatically grants Gunther a Tatto 
called "NUNDERKILLER" because Prop_TattooAdder was on the room as a 
property.&nbsp; Now, elsewhere in the realm is the second quest where Nunder's 
apprentice has escaped with an ancient artifact and is up to no good.&nbsp; 
However, to even ENTER the area where Nunder's apprentice is operating, the 
system (via the Prop_ReqTattoo property on this other Area) requires that 
Gunther already have the "NUNDERKILLER" Tattoo.&nbsp; If Gunther had not 
defeated Nunder, he would not be allowed into the realm of Nunder's 
apprentice.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
<DIV><SPAN class=453251818-08032003><STRONG><FONT color=#9400d3 size=4><BR>Q. 
How do I make poisonous drinks? </FONT></STRONG></DIV>
<DIV>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG> The best way to "mix a drink" is to make a 
GenPotion item, and add the relevant Poison_* as the potion spell effect. 
Another way is to make a GenDrink item, add the Poison_ as an effect.</P>
<DIV><SPAN class=453251818-08032003>
<P align=left><STRONG><FONT color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. How do I make other Archons? 
</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG> Using your existing Archon, issue the command 
"create item ManualArchon".&nbsp; Then have your&nbsp;other player&nbsp;get the 
manual and read it.</P>
<DIV><SPAN class=453251818-08032003>
<P align=left><STRONG><FONT color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. How do I make materials that 
the Common Skills can use? </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG> Make sure you create a GenResource, 
GenLiquidResource, or GenFoodResource item.&nbsp; Only items of this sort will 
be recognized as raw materials by the common skills.</P>
<P align=left><SPAN class=453251818-08032003><STRONG><FONT color=#9400d3 
size=4>Q. Why don't my aggressive mobs attack me? </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG> Aggressive mobs don't attack Archons, or 
anyone else with CMDROOMS or ORDER security privileges.</P>

<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG>&nbsp;Equipment which is placed on a mob and

size=4>Q. How do I make a Classless version of CoffeeMud?</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG>&nbsp; The coffeemud.ini file has a parameter 
called DISABLE.&nbsp; If CLASSES is added to the disable parameter, then 
CoffeeMud will skip the class selection process at logon, and automatically set 
the player to the normally dormant class called "PlayerClass".&nbsp; This class, 
by default, qualifies for all skills.&nbsp; If you'd like to have the 
PlayerClass qualify for only a certain subset of skills, you will need to either 
modify PlayerClass.java, or create a new GenCharClass called "PlayerClass" and 
give it your own set of skills to qualify for.&nbsp; If you want, you can create 
certain races for which there is no character class by setting the CLASSLESS 
flag within your GenRace or custom coded Race.&nbsp; This will also skip the 
class selection process for new players, and automatically select a class which 
(despite the DISABLE flag) the race qualifies for.&nbsp; See StdRace.java for 
how to code the classless() flag in races.&nbsp; See the section on 
GenCharClasses above for information on racial class qualifying.</P>
<P align=left><SPAN class=453251818-08032003><STRONG><FONT color=#9400d3

CoffeeMud</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG>&nbsp; The coffeemud.ini file has a parameter 
called DISABLE.&nbsp; If LEVELS is added to the disable parameter, then 
CoffeeMud will not allow any player to gain or lose levels, either magically or 
through normal means, despite any experience points that may be gained or 
lost.&nbsp; Individual classes and races can also be designated as being 
"levelless" through either coding custom classes and races, or through the 
GenRace/GenCharClass creation process. See StdRace.java or 
StdCharClass.java&nbsp;for how to code the classless() flag in java.&nbsp; See 
the section on GenCharClasses or GenRaces&nbsp;above for information on how to 
do it through that interface.&nbsp; Note that adding LEVELS to the DISABLE flag 
does not prevent gaining or losing experience, but just the leveling 
consequences.</SPAN></P>

One is to place Chant_Unbreakable on the item as&nbsp;permanent

only kinds of food that rot are those from the class GenFoodResource, which are 
materials FLESH or VEGETATION.&nbsp; The easiest way to make food that doesn't

<P align=left><SPAN class=453251818-08032003><STRONG>A.</STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, 
in&nbsp;several different ways.&nbsp; One is for the player to gain the 
Marketeering skill.&nbsp; This allows them to become shopkeepers, sell their 
goods, and set prices for their goods.&nbsp; Another is to "purchase" a 
ShopKeeper-type mob being sold with the property Prop_Retainable.&nbsp; A mob 
sold with that property will take up permanent residence at the players home, 
and sell the items that are given to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Money made in this 
way will go to a bank account (see StdBanker) held by the owner of the 
property.&nbsp; A third way is through Conquest.&nbsp; If the player belongs to 
a Clan, and that clan conquers an Area which has the Conquerable Behavior on it, 
the shopkeepers therein will become beholden to the leaders of that clan, 
selling any items they give to them.</SPAN></P>

<P align=left><SPAN 
class=453251818-08032003><STRONG>A.</STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.&nbsp; Put a healer 
mob up for sale at a shop.&nbsp; The healer mob should have the appropriate 
behaviors and skills to make them a healer (such as Healer, or NiceAbilities 
behaviors) and the Prop_Retainable property.&nbsp; That last will make it so 
that the player is forced to pay the mob for his services, and makes sure that 
the mob is saved at the players home.</SPAN></P>
