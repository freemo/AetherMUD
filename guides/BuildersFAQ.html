<P align=left><FONT color=darkviolet size=4><STRONG>Q. How can I get mobs into 
Grid areas?</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT color=black><STRONG>A</STRONG>. Locale types like MountainsGrid, WoodsGrid, 
WoodsMaze, PlainsGrid, DesertMaze, etc.. can all contain rejuvinating mobs in 
them.&nbsp; However, two rules need to be followed for this to work 
properly.&nbsp; The first is that you can only save mobs which are in the parent 
Grid room itself.&nbsp; If you have SYSMSGS on, you can tell which room this is 
because it is the only one with a valid room ID ("MyArea#123") in the 
description.&nbsp; The child rooms will have blank () room IDs.&nbsp; Since 
noone ever actually walks into the parent Grid room, the only way to get to it 
to deposit mobs is using the Archon GOTO command.&nbsp; The second of the two 
rules is that you must give the mob the Mobile behavior.&nbsp; The mobile 
behavior is specially coded so that it will take the mob to a random room inside 
the grid the first time the mob tries to move.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P align=left><STRONG><FONT color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. How does the CoffeeMud News feature 
work?</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A</STRONG>. Messages can be posted that will appear 
automatically at login time for those who have not yet read them.&nbsp; This is 
done by creating a "GenJournal" item and giving it the name "CoffeeMud 
News".&nbsp; Any messages posted to such a journal will appear at login 
time.&nbsp; This journal can either be made available to players, or restricted 
to Archons as you like.</P>
<P align=left><STRONG><FONT color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. How to Clans 
work?</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG> First, you need to make a 
StdClanMaster MOB somewhere in the world to create clans. A player would see 
him, and use the 'clancreate' command to create their new clan.&nbsp;The 
StdClanMaster then&nbsp;puts your clan into a pending state awaiting new 
members. You have to get at least MINCLANMEMBERS amount of new members before it 
will activate you (Set in the INI file). Activation means you will be visible in 
the listing, can buy land, can have bank accounts, and can hire mobs, as well as 
have politics with others</P>
<P align=left>Once you've made your clan, people can 'clanapply' to the clan. Of 
course, the person has to be at least level MINCLANLEVEL (Set in the INI file). 
'clanapply' can be done even if you're the only one online. Clan bosses and 
leaders will see new applicants in their 'clandetails' screen, at which point, 
they can 'clanaccept' or 'clanreject' the player (regardless of online status). 
Clan bosses can also 'clanassign' people roles, such as treasurer, leader, or 
even boss. Clan bosses and leaders may, at any time, 'clanexile' a member - as 
well as members can 'clanresign' </P>
<P align=left>Once you're accepted into a clan, you can use the clantalk channel 
to talk to your clan, as well as use the 'clanhome' spell and the 'clandonate' 
command. The 'clanhome' location and the 'clandonate' location can be set by 
bosses using the 'clanhomeset' and 'clandonateset' commands. Bosses and 
treasurers may use 'clanbalance', 'clandeposit' or 'clanwithdraw' at any banker 
to access an account with that chain. The great thing is, as long as there is at 
least one ClanMaster in the world, if MINCLANMEMBERS don't at least login in 
DAYSCLANDEATH days, then the clan will be purged automatically. </P>
