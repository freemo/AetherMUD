<p align="left"><strong>Application Information:</strong></p>
 
<p align="left">CoffeeMud is written in 100% Java, listening as a telnet
server on any specified port.&nbsp; Two web servers can be activated to listen
on specified ports. CoffeeMud  supports any JDBC/ODBC database and has been
successfully tested using MySQL, HSQLDB, and Derby&nbsp;over JDBC, and Access/SQL
Server over ODBC.  The package also includes a flat-file JDBC system for
beginners.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p align="left">The system includes an API that allows MOBs, Items, Weapons, 
Armor, Room types, Exit types, and Magic&nbsp;Items to be coded in less than
a hundred lines using a template.&nbsp; The new class can then be dropped
into the package structure, allowing it to be used after the next server
re-boot.  This is in addition to the extensive online customization capabilities.</p>
 
<p align="left">CoffeeMud utilizes a smart threading model that spawns threads 
only when necessary. It will&nbsp;balance the objects needs for threads versus 
the systems need to keep thread spawning low.&nbsp; </p>
 
<p align="left">An advanced message passing system lies at the systems core.&nbsp; 
Messages are customized for the message source, message target, and how that 
message appears to everyone else in the room.&nbsp; Each message is coded
with basic sensory information so that only the blind miss visual messages,
while they don't miss the auditory ones.&nbsp; Messages can also be previewed
and modified by every object involved, lending even more environmental realism
to coding!</p>
