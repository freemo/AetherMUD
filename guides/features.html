<P align=left><STRONG>Application Information:</STRONG></P>
<P align=left>CoffeeMud is written in 100% Java, listening 
as a telnet server on any specified port.&nbsp; Two web servers can
be activated to listen on specified ports.  CoffeeMud supports any JDBC/ODBC 
database and has been successfully tested using both MySQL over JDBC, and 
Access/SQL Server over ODBC.  The package also includes a flat-file
JDBC system for beginners.&nbsp;</P>
<P align=left>The system includes an API that allows MOBs, Items, Weapons, 
Armor, Room types, Exit types, and Magic&nbsp;Items to be coded in less than a 
hundred lines using a template.&nbsp; The new class can then be dropped into the 
package structure, allowing it to be used after the next server re-boot.  This 
is in addition to the extensive online customization capabilities.</P>
<P align=left>CoffeeMud utilizes a smart threading model that spawns threads 
only when necessary. It will&nbsp;balance the objects needs for threads versus 
the systems need to keep thread spawning low.&nbsp; </P>
<P align=left>An advanced message passing system lies at the systems core.&nbsp; 
Messages are customized for the message source, message target, and how that 
message appears to everyone else in the room.&nbsp; Each message is coded with 
basic sensory information so that only the blind miss visual messages, while 
they don't miss the auditory ones.&nbsp; Messages can also be previewed and 
modified by every object involved, lending even more environmental realism to 
coding!</P>
