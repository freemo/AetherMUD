NON-TECH
   *. A tool for quickly creating accounts and getting and/or resetting their passwords.
   *. Tie races to mob classes for character creation purposes. (Can't you do this by making class requirements include only one race?)
   *. TaxiBehavior - Wondering where I would start on making a taxi service for my mud. I would like to be able to "hail cab" and have a taxi pull up something 
      like this: "A yellow taxi pulls up to let you in." or "A yellow taxi pulls over and the door slides open to the north." Then have the player either ENTER 
      TAXI/CAB or type what ever direction the cab door opens from. After entering the cab I`d like the mob to say something like "Where ya headed?" and then 
      have the player say any number of checkpoints like this: say library -- mob replies "No problem, that will be $5, is that ok?" -- say yes OR nod -- The taxi 
      takes off through the city. After a given time, say maybe 5 seconds, the taxi pulls over and the door opens/opens to the south. Obviously here the player 
      would either EXIT TAXI/CAB or type the direction the door opens. If I could get some pointers on where to start with this I would be most thankful. - Blake
