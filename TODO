NON-TECH
   *. Spell Report -- showing how many spells of each domain mage has, versus unique spells by the Specialists -- see if can fix specialists that way.
   *. Fighter - Weapons Training (or Karate Training for Monks) -- non-kill way to gain xp, makes mobs slightly harder, 1 level up max.
   *. Fighter -- AUTOGUARD can start a little "Guarding" prog for, say, 10 rl minutes.
   *. Classes with insufficient unique skills: Charlatan (7), Alterer (9), Illusionist (10),  Ranger (11), Evoker (11), Assassin (12), Paladin (12),
        * Charlatan ideas: Break a Leg (breaks all legs), Blocking (move group members around), Monologue (pauses all actions in room until player stops talking)
                        *: Strike the Set (everything becomes invisible temporarily). Upstage -- force monsters to approach for 3 ticks, or until attack.
                        *: Exit Stage Left (every enemy flees west, for some number of ticks), Curtain Call (group trades half movement for mana/hp by bowing)
                        *: Ad Lib (possess a copy of a group member to play that role)

   *. MudFTP/DawnFTP support - lets you edit room descriptions etc. in your favourite text editor, or just for fun
   *. Clan Calendar system, that can use mud and rl dates, for scheduling things. Might send reminders -- based on journaling system of course.
   *. Lich Phylactery -- acts as a recall beacon, but only during death. If the Phylactery is destroyed then the lich loses xp and must construct a new one,
      undergoing the ritual all over again. However if they have a phylactery when they die they do not lose experience but they do have to wait until their
      corperal body is remade, giving them a waiting period in an incorporeal state.
